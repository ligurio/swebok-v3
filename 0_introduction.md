**FOREWORD**

Every profession is based on a body of knowl- edge, although that knowledge is
not always defined in a concise manner. In cases where no formality exists, the
body of knowledge is “gen- erally recognized” by practitioners and may be
codified in a variety of ways for a variety of different uses. But in many
cases, a guide to a body of knowledge is formally documented, usu- ally in a
form that permits it to be used for such purposes as development and
accreditation of academic and training programs, certification of specialists,
or professional licensing. Generally, a professional society or similar body
maintains stewardship of the formal definition of a body of knowledge.

During the past forty-five years, software engi neering has evolved from a
conference catch phrase into an engineering profession, characterized by 1) a
professional society, 2) standards that specify generally accepted professional
practices, 3) a code of ethics, 4) conference proceedings, 5) textbooks, 6)
curriculum guidelines and curricula, 7) accreditation criteria and accredited
degree programs, 8) certification and licensing, and 9) this Guide to the Body
of Knowledge. In this _Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge_ ,
the IEEE Computer Society pres ents a revised and updated version of the body
of knowledge formerly documented as SWEBOK 2004; this revised and updated
version is denoted SWEBOK V3. This work is in partial fulfillment of the
Society’s responsibility to promote the advancement of both theory and practice
for the profession of software engineering.

It should be noted that this _Guide_ does not present the entire the body of
knowledge for software engineering but rather serves as a guide to the body of
knowledge that has been developed over more than four decades. The software
engineering body of knowledge is constantly evolv- ing. Nevertheless, this
_Guide_ constitutes a valuable characterization of the software engineering
profession.

In 1958, John Tukey, the world-renowned statistician, coined the term software.
The term soft ware engineering was used in the title of a NATO conference held
in Germany in 1968. The IEEE Computer Society first published its Transactions
on Software Engineering in 1972, and a commit- tee for developing software
engineering standards was established within the IEEE Computer Society in 1976.

In 1990, planning was begun for an international standard to provide an overall
view of soft- ware engineering. The standard was completed in 1995 with
designation ISO/IEC 12207 and given the title of Standard for Software Life
Cycle Processes. The IEEE version of 12207 was published in 1996 and provided a
major foundation for the body of knowledge captured in SWEBOK 2004.  The
current version of 12207 is designated as ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and IEEE
12207-2008; it provides the basis for this SWEBOK V3.

This Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge is presented to you,
the reader, as a mechanism for acquiring the knowledge you need in your
lifelong career development as a software engineering professional.

**FOREWORD TO THE 2004 EDITION**

In this _Guide_ , the IEEE Computer Society establishes for the first time a
baseline for the body of knowledge for the field of software engineering, and
the work partially fulfills the Society’s responsibility to promote the
advancement of both theory and practice in this field. In so doing, the Society
has been guided by the experience of disciplines with longer histories but was
not bound either by their problems or their solutions.

It should be noted that the _Guide_ does not purport to define the body of
knowledge but rather to serve as a compendium and guide to the body of
knowledge that has been developing and evolving over the past four decades.
Furthermore, this body of knowledge is not static. The _Guide_ must,
necessarily, develop and evolve as software engineering matures. It
nevertheless constitutes a valuable element of the software engineering
infrastructure.

In 1958, John Tukey, the world-renowned statistician, coined the term
_software_. The term _soft- ware engineering_ was used in the title of a NATO
conference held in Germany in 1968. The IEEE Computer Society first published
its _Transactions on Software Engineering_ in 1972. The committee established
within the IEEE Computer Society for developing software engineering standards
was founded in 1976.

The first holistic view of software engineering to emerge from the IEEE
Computer Society resulted from an effort led by Fletcher Buckley to develop
IEEE standard 730 for software quality assurance, which was completed in
1979.

The purpose of IEEE Std. 730 was to provide uniform, minimum acceptable
requirements for preparation and content of software quality assurance plans.
This standard was influential in com- pleting the developing standards in the
following topics: configuration management, software testing, software
requirements, software design, and software verification and validation.

During the period 1981–1985, the IEEE Computer Society held a series of
workshops con- cerning the application of software engineering standards. These
workshops involved practitio- ners sharing their experiences with existing
standards. The workshops also held sessions on plan- ning for future standards,
including one involving measures and metrics for software engineer- ing
products and processes. The planning also resulted in IEEE Std. 1002, Taxonomy
of Software Engineering Standards (1986), which provided a new, holistic view
of software engineering. The standard describes the form and content of a
software engineering standards taxonomy. It explains the various types of
software engineering standards, their functional and external relationships,
and the role of various functions participating in the software life cycle.

In 1990, planning for an international standard with an overall view was begun.
The plan- ning focused on reconciling the software process views from IEEE Std.
1074 and the revised US DoD standard 2167A. The revision was eventually
published as DoD Std. 498. The international standard was completed in 1995
with designation, ISO/IEC 12207, and given the title of Stan- dard for Software
Life Cycle Processes. Std. ISO/IEC 12207 provided a major point of departure
for the body of knowledge captured in this book.

It was the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors’ approval of the motion put
forward in May 1993 by Fletcher Buckley which resulted in the writing of this
book. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Council approved a related
motion in August 1993. The two motions led to a joint committee under the
leadership of Mario Barbacci and Stuart Zweben who served as cochairs. The
mission statement of the joint committee was “To establish the appropriate
sets(s) of criteria and norms for professional practice of software engineering
upon which industrial decisions, professional certification, and educational
curricula can be based.” The steering committee organized task forces in the
following areas:

1. Define Required Body of Knowledge and Recommended Practices.
2. Define Ethics and Professional Standards.
3. Define Educational Curricula for undergraduate, graduate, and continuing
education.

This book supplies the first component: required body of knowledge and
recommend practices.  The code of ethics and professional practice for software
engineering was completed in 1998 and approved by both the ACM Council and the
IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors. It has been adopted by numerous
corporations and other organizations and is included in several recent
textbooks.

The educational curriculum for undergraduates is being completed by a joint
effort of the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM and is expected to be completed
in 2004.

Every profession is based on a body of knowledge and recommended practices,
although they are not always defined in a precise manner. In many cases, these
are formally documented, usually in a form that permits them to be used for
such purposes as accreditation of academic programs, development of education
and training programs, certification of specialists, or professional licensing.
Generally, a professional society or related body maintains custody of such a
formal definition. In cases where no such formality exists, the body of
knowledge and recommended practices are “generally recognized” by practitioners
and may be codified in a variety of ways for different uses.

It is hoped that readers will find this book useful in guiding them toward the
knowledge and resources they need in their lifelong career development as
software engineering professionals.  The book is dedicated to Fletcher Buckley
in recognition of his commitment to promoting software engineering as a
professional discipline and his excellence as a software engineering
practitioner in radar applications.

**INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDE**

KA Knowledge Area

SWEBOK
Software Engineering Body of
Knowledge

Publication of the 2004 version of this _Guide to the Software Engineering Body
of Knowledge_ (SWEBOK 2004) was a major milestone in establishing software
engineering as a recognized engineering discipline. The goal in developing this
update to SWEBOK is to improve the currency, readability, consistency, and
usability of the _Guide_.

All knowledge areas (KAs) have been updated to reflect changes in software
engineering since publication of SWEBOK 2004. Four new foundation KAs and a
Software Engineering Profes sional Practices KA have been added. The Software
Engineering Tools and Methods KA has been revised as Software Engineering
Models and Methods. Software engineering tools is now a topic in each of the
KAs. Three appendices provide the specifications for the KA description, an
annotated set of relevant standards for each KA, and a listing of the
references cited in the _Guide_.

This _Guide_, written under the auspices of the Professional Activities Board
of the IEEE Computer Society, represents a next step in the evolution of the
software engineering profession.

**WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?**

ISO/IEC/IEEE Systems and Software Engineering Vocabulary (SEVOCAB) defines
software engineering as “the application of a systematic, disciplined,
quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of
software; that is, the application of engineering to software).”^1

**WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SWEBOK GUIDE?**

The _Guide_ should not be confused with the Body of Knowledge itself, which
exists in the published

1 See [http://www.computer.org/sevocab.](http://www.computer.org/sevocab.)

literature. The purpose of the Guide is to describe the portion of the Body of
Knowledge that is generally accepted, to organize that portion, and to provide
topical access to it.

The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge ( SWEBOK Guide ) was
established with the following five objectives:

1. To promote a consistent view of software engineering worldwide
2. To specify the scope of, and clarify the place of software engineering with
respect to other disciplines such as computer science, project management,
computer engineering, and mathematics
3. To characterize the contents of the software engineering discipline
4. To provide a topical access to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge
5. To provide a foundation for curriculum development and for individual
certification and licensing material

The first of these objectives, a consistent worldwide view of software
engineering, was supported by a development process which engaged approximately
150 reviewers from 33 countries. More information regarding the development
process can be found on the website (www.swebok.org). Professional and learned
societies and public agencies involved in software engineering were contacted,
made aware of this project to update SWEBOK, and invited to participate in the
review process. KA editors were recruited from North America, the Pacific Rim,
and Europe. Presentations on the project were made at various international
venues. The second of the objectives, the desire to specify the scope of
software engineering, motivates the fundamental organization of the Guide. The
material that is recognized as being within this discipline is organized into
the fifteen KAs listed in Table I.1. Each of these KAs is treated in a chapter
in this Guide.

In specifying scope, it is also important to identify the disciplines that
intersect with software engineering. To this end, SWEBOK V3 also recognizes
seven related disciplines, listed in Table I.2. Software engineers should, of
course, have knowledge of material from these disciplines (and the KA
descriptions in this _Guide_ may make reference to them). It is not, however,
an objective of the _SWEBOK Guide_ to characterize the knowledge of the related
disciplines.

General Management
Mathematics

The relevant elements of computer science and mathematics are presented in the
Computing Foundations and Mathematical Foundations KAs of the _Guide_ (Chapters
13 and 14).

The organization of the KA chapters supports the third of the project’s
objectives - a characterization of the contents of software engineering. The
detailed specifications provided by the project’s editorial team to the
associate editors regarding the contents of the KA descriptions can be found in
Appendix A.

The Guide uses a hierarchical organization to decompose each KA into a set of
topics with recognizable labels. A two (sometime three) level breakdown
provides a reasonable way to find topics of interest. The Guide treats the
selected topics in a manner compatible with major schools of thought and with
breakdowns generally found in industry and in software engineering literature
and standards. The breakdowns of topics do not presume particular application
domains, business uses, management philosophies, development methods, and so
forth. The extent of each topic’s description is only that needed to understand
the generally accepted nature of the topics and for the reader to successfully
find reference material; the Body of Knowledge is found in the reference
materials themselves, not in the Guide.

REFERENCE MATERIAL AND MATRIX

To provide topical access to the knowledge-the fourth of the project’s
objectives-the Guide identifies authoritative reference material for each KA.
Appendix C provides a Consolidated Reference List for the Guide. Each KA
includes relevant references from the Consolidated Reference List and also
includes a matrix relating the reference material to the included topics.  It
should be noted that the Guide does not attempt to be comprehensive in its
citations. Much material that is both suitable and excellent is not
referenced. Material included in the Consolidated Reference List provides
coverage of the topics described.

DEPTH OF TREATMENT

To achieve the SWEBOK fifth objective-providing a foundation for curriculum
development,

Introduction

certification, and licensing, the criterion of _generally accepted_ knowledge
has been applied, to be distinguished from advanced and research knowledge (on
the grounds of maturity) and from specialized knowledge (on the grounds of
generality of application).

The equivalent term _generally recognized_ comes from the Project Management
Institute: “Generally recognized means the knowledge and practices described
are applicable to most projects most of the time, and there is consensus about
their value and usefulness.”^2 However, the terms “generally accepted” or
“generally recognized” do not imply that the designated knowledge should be
uniformly applied to all software engineering endeavors—each project’s needs
determine that—but it does imply that competent, capable software engineers
should be equipped with this knowledge for potential application. More
precisely, generally accepted knowledge should be included in the study
material for the software engineering licensing exami- nation that graduates
would take after gaining four years of work experience. Although this criterion
is specific to the US style of education and does not necessarily apply to
other countries, we deem it useful.

**STRUCTURE OF THE KA DESCRIPTIONS**

The KA descriptions are structured as follows. In the introduction, a brief
definition of the KA and an overview of its scope and of its relationship
with other KAs are presented.

_A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge_, 5th ed., Project
Management Institute, 2013; [http://www.pmi.org.](http://www.pmi.org.)

The breakdown of topics in each KA constitutes the core the KA description,
describing the decomposition of the KA into subareas, topics, and sub-topics.
For each topic or subtopic, a short description is given, along with one or
more references.

The reference material was chosen because it is considered to constitute the
best presentation of the knowledge relative to the topic. A matrix links the
topics to the reference material. The last part of each KA description is the
list of recommended references and (optionally) further readings. Relevant
standards for each KA are presented in Appendix B of the Guide.

APPENDIX A. KA DESCRIPTION SPECIFICATIONS

Appendix A describes the specifications provided by the editorial team to the
associate editors for the content, recommended references, format, and style of
the KA descriptions.

APPENDIX B. ALLOCATION OF STANDARDS TO KAS

Appendix B is an annotated list of the relevant standards, mostly from the IEEE
and the ISO, for each of the KAs of the SWEBOK Guide.

APPENDIX C. CONSOLIDATED
REFERENCE LIST

Appendix C contains the consolidated list of recommended references cited in
the KAs (these references are marked with an asterisk (*) in the text).
