**SPECIFICATIONS**

##### INTRODUCTION

This document presents the specifications pro- vided to the Knowledge Area
Editors (KA Edi- tors) regarding the Knowledge Area Descriptions (KA
Descriptions) of the Version 3 (V3) edition of the _Guide to the Software
Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide)_. This document will also enable
readers, reviewers, and users to clearly understand what specifications were
used when developing this version of the _SWEBOK Guide_.  This document begins
by situating the _SWE- BOK Guide_ as a foundational document for the IEEE
Computer Society suite of software engi- neering products and more widely
within the software engineering community at large. The role of the baseline
and the Change Control Board is then described. Criteria and require- ments are
defined for the breakdowns of topics, for the rationale underlying these
breakdowns and the succinct description of topics, and for ref- erence
materials. Important input documents are also identified, and their role within
the project is explained. Noncontent issues such as submission format and style
guidelines are also discussed.

**THE SWEBOK GUIDE IS A FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENT FOR THE IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY
SUITE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRODUCTS**

The _SWEBOK Guide_ is an IEEE Computer Soci- ety flagship and structural
document for the IEEE Computer Society suite of software engineer- ing
products. The _SWEBOK Guide_ is also more widely recognized as a foundational
document within the software engineering community at large notably through the
official recognition of the 2004 Version as ISO/IEC Technical Report
19759:2005. The list of knowledge areas (KAs) and the breakdown of topics
within each KA is described and detailed in the introduction of this SWEBOK
Guide.  Consequently, the SWEBOK Guide is founda- tional to other initiatives
within the IEEE Com- puter Society:

a) The list of KAs and the breakdown of topics within each KA are also adopted
by the soft- ware engineering certification and associated professional
development products offered by the IEEE Computer Society (see http://www.
computer.org/certification).

b) The list of KAs and the breakdown of top- ics are also foundational to the
software engineering curricula guidelines developed or endorsed by the IEEE
Computer Society (www.computer.org/portal/web/education/ Curricula).

c) The Consolidated Reference List (see Appen- dix C), meaning the list of
recommended reference materials (to the level of section number) that
accompanies the breakdown of topics within each KA is also adopted by the
software engineering certification and asso- ciated professional development
products offered by the IEEE Computer Society.

BASELINE AND CHANGE CONTROL BOARD

Due to the structural nature of the SWEBOK Guide and its adoption by other
products, a base- line was developed at the outset of the project comprised of
the list of KAs, the breakdown of topics within each KA, and the Consolidated
Ref- erence List.

A Change Control Board (CCB) has been in place for the development of this
version to han- dle all change requests to this baseline coming from the KA
Editors, arising during the review process, or otherwise. Change requests must
be approved both by the _SWEBOK Guide_ Editors and by the CCB before being
implemented. This CCB is comprised of members of the initiatives listed above
and acting under the authority of the Software and Systems Engineering
Committee of the IEEE Computer Society Professional Activi- ties Board.

**CRITERIA AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BREAKDOWN OF TOPICS WITHIN A KNOWLEDGE
AREA**

a) KA Editors are instructed to adopt the base- line breakdown of topics.

b) The breakdown of topics is expected to be “reasonable,” not “perfect.”

c) The breakdown of topics within a KA must decompose the subset of the
Software Engi- neering Body of Knowledge that is “gen- erally recognized.” See
below for a more detailed discussion of this point.

d) The breakdown of topics within a KA must not presume specific application
domains, business needs, sizes of organizations, organi- zational structures,
management philosophies, software life cycle models, software technolo- gies,
or software development methods.

e) The breakdown of topics must, as much as possible, be compatible with the
vari- ous schools of thought within software engineering.

f) The breakdown of topics within a KA must be compatible with the breakdown of
soft- ware engineering generally found in indus- try and in the software
engineering literature and standards.

g) The breakdown of topics is expected to be as inclusive as possible.

h) The SWEBOK Guide adopts the position that even though the following “themes”
are common across all Knowledge Areas, they are also an integral part of all
Knowledge Areas and therefore must be incorporated into the proposed breakdown
of topics of each Knowledge Area. These common themes are measurement, quality
(in gen- eral), and security.

i) The breakdown of topics should be at most two or three levels deep. Even
though no upper or lower limit is imposed on the num- ber of topics within each
KA, a reasonable and manageable number of topics is expected to be included in
each KA. Emphasis should also be put on the selection of the topics themselves
rather than on their organization in an appropriate hierarchy.

j) Topic names must be significant enough to be meaningful even when cited
outside the SWEBOK Guide.

k) The description of a KA will include a chart (in tree form) describing the
knowledge breakdown.

CRITERIA AND REQUIREMENTS FOR DESCRIBING TOPICS

Topics need only be sufficiently described so the reader can select the
appropriate reference mate- rial according to his/her needs. Topic descrip-
tions must not be prescriptive.

CRITERIA AND REQUIREMENTS FOR REFERENCE MATERIAL

a) KA Editors are instructed to use the refer- ences (to the level of section
number) allo- cated to their KA by the Consolidated Refer- ence List as their
Recommended References.  b) There are three categories of reference material:

» Recommended References. The set of Recommended References (to the level of
section number) is collectively known as the Consolidated Reference List.
» Further Readings.
» Additional references cited in the KA Description (for example, the source of
a quotation or reference material in support of a rationale behind a particular
argument).

c) The _SWEBOK Guide_ is intended by defini- tion to be selective in its choice
of topics and associated reference material. The list of reference material
should be clearly viewed as an “informed and reasonable selection” rather than
as a definitive list.

d) Reference material can be book chapters, refereed journal papers, refereed
confer- ence papers, refereed technical or industrial reports, or any other
type of recognized arti- fact. References to another KA, subarea, or topic are
also permitted.

e) Reference material must be generally avail- able and must not be
confidential in nature.

f) Reference material must be in English.

g) Criteria and requirements for recommended reference material or Consolidated
Refer- ence List:

» Collectively the list of Recommended References should be

i. complete: covering the entire scope of the SWEBOK Guide
ii. sufficient: providing enough
information to describe “gener-
ally accepted” knowledge
iii. consistent: not providing contra-
dictory knowledge nor conflict-
ing practices
iv. credible: recognized as providing
expert treatment
v. current: treating the subject in
a manner that is commensurate
with currently generally accepted
knowledge
vi. succinct: as short as possible
(both in number of reference
items and in total page count)
without failing other objectives.

» Recommended reference material must be identified for each topic. Each recom-
mended reference item may of course cover multiple topics. Exceptionally, a
topic may be self-descriptive and not cite a reference material item (for
example, a topic that is a definition or a topic for which the description
itself without any cited reference material is sufficient for the objectives of
the SWEBOK Guide ).
» Each reference to the recommended reference material should be as precise as
possible by identifying what specific chapter or section is relevant.
» A matrix of reference material (to the level of section number) versus topics
must be provided.
» A reasonable amount of recommended reference material must be identified for
each KA. The following guidelines should be used in determining how much is
reasonable:

i. If the recommended reference
material were written in a coher-
ent manner that followed the pro-
posed breakdown of topics and in
a uniform style (for example, in a
new book based on the proposed
KA description), an average tar-
get across all KAs for the number
of pages would be 750. However,
this target may not be attainable
when selecting existing reference
material due to differences in
style and overlap and redundancy
between the selected reference
materials.
ii. In other words, the target for the
number of pages for the entire
collection of recommended refer-
ences of the SWEBOK Guide is
in the range of 10,000 to 15,000
pages.
iii. Another way of viewing this is
that the amount of recommended
reference material would be
reasonable if it consisted of the
study material on this KA for a
software engineering licensing
exam that a graduate would pass
after completing four years of
work experience.

h) Additional reference material can be included by the KA Editor in a “Further
Readings” list:


» These further readings must be related to
the topics in the breakdown rather than,
for example, to more advanced topics.
» The list must be annotated (within 1
paragraph per reference) as to why this
reference material was included in the
list of further readings. Further readings
could include: new versions of an exist-
ing reference already included in the
recommended references, alternative
viewpoints on a KA, or a seminal treat-
ment of a KA.
» A general guideline to be followed is 10
or fewer further readings per KA.
» There is no matrix of the reference
materials listed in further readings and
the breakdown of topics.

i) Criteria and requirements regarding addi-
tional references cited in the KA Description:


» The SWEBOK Guide is not a research
document and its readership will be var-
ied. Therefore, a delicate balance must
be maintained between ensuring a high
level of readability within the document
while maintaining its technical excel-
lence. Additional reference material
should therefore only be brought in by
the KA Editor if it is necessary to the
discussion. Examples are to identify the
source of a quotation or to cite reference
item in support of a rationale behind a
particular and important argument.

**COMMON STRUCTURE**

KA descriptions should use the following structure:

- Acronyms
- Introduction
- Breakdown of Topics of the KA (including a
    figure describing the breakdown)
- Matrix of Topics vs. Reference Material
- List of Further Readings
- References

##### WHAT DO WE MEAN BY “GENERALLY

##### RECOGNIZED KNOWLEDGE”?

The Software Engineering Body of Knowledge is an all-inclusive term that
describes the sum of knowledge within the profession of software engineering.
However, the SWEBOK Guide seeks to identify and describe that subset of the
body of knowledge that is generally recognized or, in other words, the core
body of knowledge. To bet- ter illustrate what “generally recognized” knowl-
edge is relative to other types of knowledge, Figure A.1 proposes a
three-category schema for classifying knowledge.  The Project Management
Institute in its Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge defines
“generally recognized” knowledge for project management as being:

that subset of the project management body of knowledge generally recognized as
good practice. “Generally recognized” means the knowledge and practices
described are applicable to most projects most of the time, and there is
consensus about their value and usefulness. “Good practice” means there is
general agreement that the application of these skills, tools, and techniques
can enhance the chances of success over a wide range of projects.  “Good
practice” does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied
uniformly to all projects; the orga- nization and/or project management team is
responsible for determining what is appropriate for any given project. [1]

“Generally accepted” knowledge could also be viewed as knowledge to be included
in the study material of a software engineering licensing exam (in the USA)
that a graduate would take after completing four years of work experience.
These two definitions should be seen as complementary.  KA Editors are also
expected to be somewhat forward looking in their interpretation by tak- ing
into consideration not only what is “gener- ally recognized” today and but what
they expect will be “generally recognized” in a 3- to 5-year timeframe.

##### LENGTH OF KA DESCRIPTION

KA Descriptions are to be roughly 10 to 20 pages using the formatting template
for papers pub- lished in conference proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society.
This includes text, references, appendices, tables, etc. This, of course, does
not include the reference materials themselves.

This document “provides guidelines and rec- ommendations” for defining the
curricula of a professional master’s level program in software engineering. The
_SWEBOK Guide_ is identified as a “primary reference” in developing the body of
knowledge underlying these guidelines. This document has been officially
endorsed by the IEEE Computer Society and sponsored by the Association for
Computing Machinery.

This standard is considered the key standard regarding the definition of life
cycle processes and has been adopted by the two main standardization bodies in
software engineering: ISO/IEC JTC1/ SC7 and the IEEE Computer Society Software
and Systems Engineering Standards Committees.  It also has been designated as a
pivotal standard by the Software and System Engineering Stan- dards Committee
(S2ESC) of the IEEE.  Even though we do not intend that the Guide to the
Software Engineering Body of Knowledge be fully 12207-conformant, this standard
remains a key input to the SWEBOK Guide , and special care will be taken
throughout the SWEBOK Guide regarding the compatibility of the Guide with the
12207 standard.

widely used soft- ware engineering standards. It concentrates on important
software engineering activities—qual- ity and project management, system
engineer- ing, dependability, and safety. The analysis and regrouping of the
standard collections exposes the reader to key relationships between standards.
Even though the SWEBOK Guide is not a soft- ware engineering standard per se,
special care will be taken throughout the document regarding the compatibility
of the Guide with the current IEEE and ISO/IEC Systems and Software Engi-
neering Standards Collection.

**STYLE AND TECHNICAL GUIDELINES**

- KA Descriptions should conform to the Word template available at
[http://www.computer.](http://www.computer.) org/portal/web/cscps/formatting.
- KA Descriptions are expected to follow the IEEE Computer Society Style Guide
(www.  computer.org/portal/web/publications/ styleguide).
- Files are to be submitted in Microsoft Word format.
- All citations of reference material are to be produced using EndNote Web as
indicated in the instructions provided to KA Editors in this regard.

**OTHER DETAILED GUIDELINES**

When referencing the _Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge_ ,
use the title “ _SWEBOK Guide._ ” For the purpose of simplicity, avoid
footnotes and try to include their content in the main text.  Use explicit
references to standards, as opposed to simply inserting numbers referencing
items in the bibliography. We believe this approach allows the reader to be
better exposed to the source and scope of a standard.

The text accompanying figures and tables should be self-explanatory or have
enough related text. This would ensure that the reader knows what the figures
and tables mean.  To make sure that some information in the SWEBOK Guide does
not become rapidly obso- lete and due to its generic nature, please avoid
directly naming tools and products. Instead, try to name their functions.

EDITING

Editors of the SWEBOK Guide as well as profes- sional copy editors will edit KA
Descriptions.  Editing includes copy editing (grammar, punc- tuation, and
capitalization), style editing (confor- mance to the Computer Society style
guide), and content editing (flow, meaning, clarity, direct- ness, and
organization). The final editing will be a collaborative process in which the
Editors of the SWEBOK Guide and the KA Editors work together to achieve a
concise, well-worded, and useful KA Description.

RELEASE OF COPYRIGHT

All intellectual property rights associated with the SWEBOK Guide will remain
with the IEEE.  KA Editors must sign a copyright release form.  It is also
understood that the SWEBOK Guide will continue to be available free of charge
in the public domain in at least one format, provided by the IEEE Computer
Society through web technology or by other means.

**APPENDIX B**

**IEEE AND ISO/IEC STANDARDS SUPPORTING**

**THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BODY OF**

**KNOWLEDGE (SWEBOK)**

Some might say that the supply of software engi- neering standards far exceeds
the demand. One seldom listens to a briefing on the subject without suffering
some apparently obligatory joke that there are too many of them. However, the
exis- tence of standards takes a very large (possibly infinite) trade space of
alternatives and reduces that space to a smaller set of choices—a huge
advantage for users. Nevertheless, it can still be difficult to choose from
dozens of alternatives, so supplementary guidance, like this appendix, can be
helpful. A summary list of the standards men- tioned in this appendix appears
at the end.  To reduce tedium in reading, a few simplifica- tions and
abridgements are made in this appendix:

- ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 maintains nearly two
    hundred standards on the subject. IEEE
    maintains about fifty. The two organizations
    are in the tenth year of a systematic program
    to coordinate and integrate their collections.
    In general, this article will focus on the stan-
    dards that are recognized by both organiza-
    tions, taking this condition as evidence that
    wide agreement has been obtained. Other
    standards will be mentioned briefly.
- Standards tend to have long, taxonomical
    titles. If there were a single standard for
    building an automobile, the one for your
    Camry probably would be titled something
    like, “Vehicle, internal combustion, four-
    wheel, passenger, sedan.” Also, modern stan-
    dards organizations provide their standards
    from databases. Like any database, these
    sometimes contain errors, particularly for the
    titles. So this article will often paraphrase the


title of the standard or simply use its number.
In obtaining a standard of interest, the reader
should rely on the number, not the title, given
in this article. For reasons of consistency, the
article will use the IEEE’s convention for the
capitalization of titles—nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and first and last
words have an initial capital letter—despite
the fact that IEEE and ISO/IEC use differing
conventions.

- Because these standards are being continu-
    ally revised to take account of new technolo-
    gies and usage patterns, this article will be
    obsolescent before it is published. Therefore,
    it will occasionally discuss standards that
    have not yet been published, if they are likely
    to assume significant importance.
- Explicit trademarks are omitted. Suffice it to
    say that IEEE places a trademark on all of its
    standards’ designations.


There are some other conventions of interest:

- In both IEEE and ISO/IEC, standards for
    _systems_ engineering are maintained by the
    same committee as those for _software_ engi-
    neering. Many of the standards apply to both.
    So, instead of making fine distinctions, this
    article will deal with both.
- On the other hand, both S2ESC and SC 7
    (see below for descriptions of these orga-
    nizations) are responsible for standards
    that don’t qualify as “engineering.” In the
    US and many other countries, the services
    of a licensed engineer are required when a
    product might affect public safety, health,


and welfare as opposed to affecting merely
the pocketbook of the client. This appendix
will respect that distinction and ignore stan-
dards that appear to be merely economic in
consequence.

- User documentation is assumed to be devel-
    oped similarly to software. For example,
    a standard concerning the design of user
    documentation is described in the Software
    Design KA.
- Some jointly developed standards are explic-
    itly labeled as joint developments, e.g., ISO/
    IEC/IEEE 24765. In other cases, the stan-
    dards have different designations in the two
    organizations. Examples include


» IEEE Std. 12207:2008 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC
12207:2008), where “a.k.a.” (“also
known as”) is this appendix’s abbrevia-
tion to note the designation in the other
organization;
» IEEE Std. 15939:2008 Standard Adop-
tion of ISO/IEC 15939:2007, an adop-
tion by IEEE of a standard developed in
ISO/IEC;
» IEEE Std. 1220:2005 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC
26702:2007), a “fast-track” by ISO/IEC
of a standard developed in IEEE.


In each of these cases, the standards are
substantively identical in the two orga-
nizations, differing only in front matter
and, occasionally, added informational
material.

A summary list of all of the mentioned stan-
dards is provided at the end of this appendix.

**ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7, SOFTWARE AND
SYSTEMS ENGINEERING**

ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 is the major source of
international standards on software and systems
engineering. Its name is formed taxonomically.
Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) is a child
of the International Organization for Standardiza-
tion (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC); it has the scope of “informa-
tion technology” and subdivides its work among
a number of subcommittees; Subcommittee 7 (SC


7) is the one responsible for software and sys-
tems engineering. SC 7, and its working groups,
meets twice a year, attracting delegations repre-
senting the national standards bodies of partici-
pating nations. Each nation follows its own pro-
cedures for determining national positions and
each nation has the responsibility of determining
whether an ISO/IEC standard should be adopted
as a national standard.
SC 7 creates three types of documents:

- International Standards: Documents contain-
    ing requirements that must be satisfied in
    order to claim conformance.
- Technical Specifications (formerly called
    Technical Reports, type 1 and type 2): Docu-
    ments published in a preliminary manner
    while work continues.
- Technical Reports (formerly called Techni-
    cal Reports, type 3): Documents inherently
    unsuited to be standards, usually because
    they are descriptive rather than prescriptive.


The key thing to remember is that only the
first category counts as a consensus standard.
The reader can easily recognize the others by the
suffix TS or TR prepended to the number of the
document.


IEEE SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS
ENGINEERING STANDARDS
COMMITTEE (S2ESC)


IEEE is the world’s largest organization of tech-
nical professionals, with about 400,000 members
in more than 160 countries. The publication of
standards is performed by the IEEE Standards
Association (IEEE-SA), but the committees that
draft and sponsor the standards are in the various
IEEE societies; S2ESC is a part of the IEEE Com-
puter Society. IEEE is a global standards maker
because its standards are used in many differ-
ent countries. Despite its international member-
ship (about 50% non-US), though, the IEEE-SA
routinely submits its standards to the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) for endorse-
ment as “American National Standards.” Some
S2ESC standards are developed within S2ESC,
some are developed jointly with SC 7, and some
are adopted after being developed by SC 7.



Appendix B B-3


IEEE-SA publishes three types of “standards”:

- Standards, with a preponderance of the verb
    “shall”
- Recommended Practices, with a preponder-
    ance of the verb “should”
- Guides, with a preponderance of the verb
    “may.”

All three of these compare to ISO/IEC stan-
dards. IEEE-SA does have the concept of a “Trial-
Use” standard, which is roughly comparable to
an ISO/IEC Technical Specification. However, it
has nothing comparable to an ISO/IEC Techni-
cal Report; one would look elsewhere in IEEE for
documents of this ilk.

**THE STANDARDS**

The remainder of this article allocates the selected
standards to relevant knowledge areas (KAs) of
the _SWEBOK Guide_. There is a section for each
KA. Within each section, the relevant standards
are listed—the ones that principally apply to the
KA as well as others that principally apply to
other KAs but which are also related to the cur-
rent one. Following each standard is a brief sum-
mary. In most cases, the summary is a quotation
or paraphrase of the abstract or other introductory
material from the text of the standard.
Most of the standards easily fit into one KA.
Some fit into more than one; in such cases,
a cross-reference is provided. Two standards
apply to all KAs, so they are listed in a category
called “General.” All of the standards related to
computer-aided software engineering (CASE)
tools and environments are listed in the Software
Engineering Models and Methods KA section.

**GENERAL**

The first two standards are so central that they
could be slotted into all of the KAs. Two more are
described in the Software Engineering Process
KA, but are mentioned here because they provide
a helpful framework and because the descriptions
of several other standards refer to them.
ISO/IEC TR 19759 is the _SWEBOK Guide_
itself. It’s not an IEEE standard because, lacking
prescriptive verbs, it doesn’t satisfy the criteria


for any of the IEEE categories. In ISO/IEC, it is a
“technical report”—defined as a document inher-
ently unsuited to be a standard. The 2004 IEEE
SWEBOK Guide was adopted by ISO/IEC with-
out change. Presumably, ISO/IEC will adopt Ver-
sion 3 of the SWEBOK Guide.


ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005 Software Engineering—
Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge
(SWEBOK)
Applies to all KAs


ISO/IEC 19759:2005, a Guide to the Software
Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) ,
identifies and describes that subset of the body
of knowledge that is generally accepted, even
though software engineers must be knowledge-
able not only in software engineering, but also,
of course, in other related disciplines. SWEBOK
is an all-inclusive term that describes the sum
of knowledge within the profession of software
engineering.


The text of the SWEBOK Guide is freely avail-
able at http://www.swebok.org/. The ISO/IEC adoption
of the Guide is freely available at http://standards.
iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.
html.
ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765 provides a shared vocab-
ulary for the systems and software engineering
standards of both SC 7 and S2ESC.


ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 Systems and Software
Engineering—Vocabulary
Applies to all KAs


ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 provides a common
vocabulary applicable to all systems and software
engineering work. It was prepared to collect and
support the standardization of terminology. ISO/
IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 is intended to serve as a
useful reference for those in the information tech-
nology field and to encourage the use of systems
and software engineering standards prepared by
ISO and liaison organizations IEEE Computer
Society and Project Management Institute. ISO/
IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 includes references to the


active source standards for each definition so that
the use of the term can be further explored.

The vocabulary is descriptive, rather than pre-
scriptive; it gathers up all of the definitions from
all of the relevant standards, as well as a few
other sources, rather than choosing among com-
peting definitions.
The content of the 24765 standard is freely
accessible online at [http://www.computer.org/sevocab.](http://www.computer.org/sevocab.)
Two standards, 12207 and 15288, provide a
complete set of processes for the entire life cycle
of a system or a software product. The two stan-
dards are aligned for concurrent use on a single
project or in a single organization. They are
mentioned here because they are often used as a
framework for explaining or localizing the role of
other standards in the life cycle.

##### SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The primary standard for software and systems
requirements engineering is a new one that
replaced several existing IEEE standards. It pro-
vides a broad view of requirements engineering
across the entire life cycle.

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 Systems and Software
Engineering—Life Cycle Processes—Requirements
Engineering**

ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 contains provisions
for the processes and products related to the engi-
neering of requirements for systems and software
products and services throughout the life cycle.


It defines the construct of a good requirement,
provides attributes and characteristics of require-
ments, and discusses the iterative and recursive
application of requirements processes through-
out the life cycle. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011
provides additional guidance in the application
of requirements engineering and management
processes for requirements-related activities in
ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and ISO/IEC 15288:2008.
Information items applicable to the engineering
of requirements and their content are defined.
The content of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 can
be added to the existing set of requirements-
related life cycle processes defined by ISO/IEC
12207:2008 or ISO/IEC 15288:2008, or it can be
used independently.


A multipart ISO/IEC standard provides princi-
ples and methods for “sizing” software based on
its requirements. The functional size is often use-
ful in the denominator of measurements of qual-
ity and productivity in software development. It
may also play a role in contracting for service-
level agreements.


ISO/IEC 14143 [six parts] Information Technol-
ogy—Software Measurement—Functional Size
Measurement


ISO/IEC 14143 describes FSM (functional size
measurement). The concepts of functional size
measurement (FSM) are designed to overcome the
limitations of earlier methods of sizing software by
shifting the focus away from measuring how the
software is implemented to measuring size in terms
of the functions required by the user.


FSM is often known as “function point count-
ing.” The four standards listed below are alter-
native methods for function point counting—all
meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 14143. The
dominant method, in terms of market share, is
the IFPUG method, described in ISO/IEC 20926.
Other methods are variations intended to improve
the validity of the count in various circumstances.
For example, ISO/IEC 19761 — COSMIC is



Appendix B B-5

notably intended to be used on software with a
real-time component.

**ISO/IEC 19761:2011 Software Engineering—COS-
MIC: A Functional Size Measurement Method**

**ISO/IEC 20926:2009 Software and Systems Engi-
neering—Software Measurement—IFPUG Func-
tional Size Measurement Method**

**ISO/IEC 20968:2002 Software Engineering—Mk
II Function Point Analysis—Counting Practices
Manual**

**ISO/IEC 24570:2005 Software Engineering—
NESMA Functional Size Measurement Method Ver-
sion 2.1—Definitions and Counting Guidelines for
the Application of Function Point Analysis**

Sometimes requirements are described in natu-
ral language, but sometimes they are described
in formal or semiformal notations. The objective
of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is to
provide system architects, software engineers,
and software developers with tools for analysis,
design, and implementation of software-based
systems as well as for modeling business and
similar processes. The two parts of ISO/IEC
19505 define UML, revision 2. The older ISO/
IEC 19501 is an earlier version of UML. They
are mentioned here because they are often used to
model requirements.

nology** **_—_** **Object Management Group Unified Model-
ing Language (OMG UML)**
See Software Engineering Models and
Methods KA

##### SOFTWARE DESIGN


The software design KA includes both software
architectural design (for determining the relation-
ships among the items of the software and detailed
design (for describing the individual items). ISO/
IEC/IEEE 42010 concerns the description of
architecture for systems and software.


ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 Systems and Software
Engineering — Architecture Description


ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 addresses the cre-
ation, analysis, and sustainment of architec-
tures of systems through the use of architecture
descriptions. A conceptual model of architecture
description is established. The required contents
of an architecture description are specified. Archi-
tecture viewpoints, architecture frameworks and
architecture description languages are introduced
for codifying conventions and common practices
of architecture description. The required content
of architecture viewpoints, architecture frame-
works and architecture description languages
is specified. Annexes provide the motivation
and background for key concepts and terminol-
ogy and examples of applying ISO/IEC/IEEE
42010:2011.


Like ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010, the next stan-
dard treats software “design” as an abstraction,
independent of its representation in a document.
Accordingly, the standard places provisions on
the description of design, rather than on design
itself.


IEEE Std. 1016-2009 Standard for Information
Technology — Systems Design — Software Design
Descriptions


This standard describes software designs and
establishes the information content and organiza-
tion of a software design description (SDD). An
SDD is a representation of a software design to be
used for recording design information and com-
municating that design information to key design


stakeholders. This standard is intended for use in
design situations in which an explicit software
design description is to be prepared. These situ-
ations include traditional software construction
activities (when design leads to code) and reverse
engineering situations (when a design description
is recovered from an existing implementation).
This standard can be applied to commercial, sci-
entific, or military software that runs on digital
computers. Applicability is not restricted by the
size, complexity, or criticality of the software.
This standard can be applied to the description
of high-level and detailed designs. This stan-
dard does not prescribe specific methodologies
for design, configuration management, or qual-
ity assurance. This standard does not require the
use of any particular design languages, but estab-
lishes requirements on the selection of design
languages for use in an SDD. This standard can
be applied to the preparation of SDDs captured as
paper documents, automated databases, software
development tools, or other media.

By convention, this appendix treats user docu-
mentation as a part of a software system. There-
fore, the various aspects of user documentation—
its design, its testing, and so forth—are allocated
to different KAs. The next standard deals with the
design of user documentation.

**IEEE Std. 26514-2010 Standard Adoption of ISO/
IEC 26514:2008 Systems and Software Engineer-
ing** **_—_** **Requirements for Designers and Developers of
User Documentation**

This standard provides requirements for the
design and development of software user docu-
mentation as part of the life cycle processes. It
defines the documentation process from the view-
point of the documentation developer and also
covers the documentation product. It specifies the
structure, content, and format for user documen-
tation and also provides informative guidance for
user documentation style. It is independent of the
software tools that may be used to produce docu-
mentation and applies to both printed documenta-
tion and onscreen documentation. Much of this


standard is also applicable to user documentation
for systems including hardware.

##### SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION


The term “software construction” refers to the
detailed creation of working, meaningful software
through a combination of coding, verification,
unit testing, integration testing, and debugging.
There are few standards on the details of soft-
ware coding. It has been found through (mostly
bad) experience that coding conventions are not
appropriate for standardization because, in most
cases, the real benefit comes from the consis-
tency of applying an arbitrary convention rather
than the convention itself. So, although coding
conventions are a good idea, it is generally left
to the organization or the project to develop such
a standard.
Nevertheless, the subject of secure coding has
attracted attention in recent years because some
coding idioms are insecure in the face of attack.
A Technical Report prepared by ISO/IEC JTC 1/
SC 22 (programming languages) describes vul-
nerabilities in programming languages and how
they can be avoided.


ISO/IEC TR 24772:2013 Information Technology —
Programming Languages — Guidance to Avoiding
Vulnerabilities in Programming Languages through
Language Selection and Use


ISO/IEC TR 24772:2013 specifies software pro-
gramming language vulnerabilities to be avoided
in the development of systems where assured
behavior is required for security, safety, mis-
sion-critical, and business-critical software. In
general, this guidance is applicable to the soft-
ware developed, reviewed, or maintained for any
application.
Vulnerabilities are described in a generic man-
ner that is applicable to a broad range of pro-
gramming languages. Annexes relate the generic
guidance to a selection of specific programming
languages.



Appendix B B-7

The Technical Report is freely available at [http://](http://)
standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/
index.html.
Two standards are mentioned here because unit
testing is often regarded as an activity of software
construction. IEEE and ISO/IEC are cooperating
in the development of a four-part joint standard,
29119, that will provide a comprehensive treat-
ment of testing and supplant IEEE Std. 1008.

**IEEE Std. 1008-1987 Standard for Software Unit
Testing**
See Software Testing KA

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 [four parts] (Draft) Software
and Systems Engineering** **_—_** **Software Testing**
See Software Testing KA

The next standard provides for the development
of user documentation during an agile devel-
opment process. It is mentioned here because
agile development is sometimes regarded as
construction.

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 26515:2012 Systems and Software
Engineering** **_—_** **Developing User Documentation in an
Agile Environment**
See Software Engineering Models and
Methods KA

Coding is not the only way to create a software
product. Often code (as well as requirements and
design) is reused from previous projects or engi-
neered for reuse in future projects. IEEE Std. 1517
is mentioned here because it provides a common
framework for extending the system and software
life cycle processes of IEEE Std. 12207:2008 to
include the systematic practice of reuse.

**IEEE Std. 1517-2010 Standard for Information
Technology** **_—_** **System and Software Life Cycle Pro-
cesses** **_—_** **Reuse Processes**
See Software Engineering Process KA

##### SOFTWARE TESTING


Oddly, there are few standards for testing. IEEE
Std. 829 is the most comprehensive.


IEEE Std. 829-2008 Standard for Software and Sys-
tem Test Documentation


Test processes determine whether the develop-
ment products of a given activity conform to the
requirements of that activity and whether the sys-
tem and/or software satisfies its intended use and
user needs. Testing process tasks are specified
for different integrity levels. These process tasks
determine the appropriate breadth and depth of
test documentation. The documentation elements
for each type of test documentation can then be
selected. The scope of testing encompasses soft-
ware-based systems, computer software, hard-
ware, and their interfaces. This standard applies
to software-based systems being developed,
maintained, or reused (legacy, commercial off-
the-shelf, nondevelopmental items). The term
“software” also includes firmware, microcode,
and documentation. Test processes can include
inspection, analysis, demonstration, verification,
and validation of software and software-based
system products.


IEEE Std. 1008 focuses on unit testing.


IEEE Std. 1008 - 1987 Standard for Software Unit
Testing


The primary objective is to specify a standard
approach to software unit testing that can be
used as a basis for sound software engineer-
ing practice. A second objective is to describe
the software engineering concepts and testing
assumptions on which the standard approach is
based. A third objective is to provide guidance
and resource information to assist with the imple-
mentation and usage of the standard unit testing
approach.


IEEE and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 are cooperating
in a project to develop a single comprehensive
standard that covers all aspects of testing. One
can hope for publication of the four-part standard
by 2014. Portions of the content remain contro-
versial. One taxonomical issue is whether “static
methods”—such as inspection, review, and static
analysis—should fall within the scope of “test-
ing” or should be distinguished as “verification
and validation.” Although the resolution of the
issue is probably of little importance to users of
the standard, it assumes great importance to the
standards-writers who must manage an integrated
suite of interoperating standards.

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 [four parts] (Draft) Software
and Systems Engineering** **_—_** **Software Testing**

The purpose of ISO/IEC 29119 Software Testing
is to define an internationally agreed standard for
software testing that can be used by any orga-
nization when performing any form of software
testing.

Testing of user documentation is described in
the next standard, providing requirements for the
test and review of software user documentation
as part of the life cycle processes. It defines the
documentation process from the viewpoint of the
documentation tester and reviewer. It is relevant
to roles involved in testing and development of
software and user documentation, including proj-
ect managers, usability experts, and information
developers in addition to testers and reviewers.

**IEEE Std. 26513-2010 Standard Adoption of ISO/
IEC 26513:2009 Systems and Software Engineer-
ing** **_—_** **Requirements for Testers and Reviewers of
Documentation**

ISO/IEC 26513 provides the minimum require-
ments for the testing and reviewing of user docu-
mentation, including both printed and onscreen
documents used in the work environment by the
users of systems software. It applies to printed
user manuals, online help, tutorials, and user ref-
erence documentation.


It specifies processes for use in testing and
reviewing of user documentation. It is not lim-
ited to the test and review phase of the life cycle,
but includes activities throughout the information
management and documentation management
processes.


Two standards are mentioned here because
some sources consider software verification and
validation to be taxonomically included in testing.

ware Verification and Validation

IEEE Std. 1044-2009 Standard for Classification for
Software Anomalies

##### SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE


This standard—the result of harmonizing distinct
IEEE and ISO/IEC standards on the subject—
describes a single comprehensive process for the
management and execution of software mainte-
nance. It expands on the provisions of the soft-
ware maintenance process provided in ISO/IEC/
IEEE 12207.


IEEE Std. 14764-2006 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC 14764:2006)
Standard for Software Engineering—Software Life
Cycle Processes—Maintenance


ISO/IEC 14764:2006 describes in greater
detail management of the maintenance process
described in ISO/IEC 12207, including amend-
ments. It also establishes definitions for the vari-
ous types of maintenance. ISO/IEC 14764:2006
provides guidance that applies to planning, exe-
cution and control, review and evaluation, and
closure of the maintenance process. The scope of
ISO/IEC 14764:2006 includes maintenance for
multiple software products with the same main-
tenance resources. “Maintenance” in ISO/IEC
14764:2006 means software maintenance unless
otherwise stated.



Appendix B B-9

ISO/IEC 14764:2006 provides the framework
within which generic and specific software main-
tenance plans may be executed, evaluated, and
tailored to the maintenance scope and magni-
tude of given software products. It provides the
framework, precise terminology, and processes
to allow the consistent application of technol-
ogy (tools, techniques, and methods) to software
maintenance.
It does not address the operation of software
and the operational functions, e.g., backup,
recovery, and system administration, which are
normally performed by those who operate the
software.
ISO/IEC 14764:2006 is written primarily for
maintainers of software and additionally for those
responsible for development and quality assur-
ance. It may also be used by acquirers and users
of systems containing software, who may provide
inputs to the maintenance plan.

##### SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION

##### MANAGEMENT

There is one standard for configuration
management.

**IEEE Std. 828-2012 Standard for Configuration
Management in Systems and Software Engineering**

This standard establishes the minimum require-
ments for processes for configuration management
(CM) in systems and software engineering. The
application of this standard applies to any form,
class, or type of software or system. This revision
of the standard expands the previous version to
explain CM, including identifying and acquiring
configuration items, controlling changes, report-
ing the status of configuration items, as well as
software builds and release engineering. Its pre-
decessor defined only the contents of a software
configuration management plan. This standard
addresses what CM activities are to be done, when
they are to happen in the life cycle, and what plan-
ning and resources are required. It also describes
the content areas for a CM plan. The standard sup-
ports ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2008 and ISO/IEC/
IEEE 15288:2008 and adheres to the terminology


in ISO/IEC/IEEE Std. 24765 and the information
item requirements of IEEE Std. 15939.


ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 has not yet determined
what action it should take regarding the new
IEEE Std. 828. There are issues concerning the
extent of compatibility with ISO/IEC/IEEE
12207 and other standards in the SC 7 suite. It
should be noted, though, that SC 7 does not have
a competing standard.


SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
MANAGEMENT


Most readers will interpret the phrase “software
engineering management” to mean the manage-
ment of a project that concerns software. There
are at least two possible extensions to this gen-
eralization, though. Some software activities are
managed according to a service-level agreement
(SLA). SLAs do not meet the criteria for “proj-
ect” according to some definitions. Also, it has
become generally agreed that some management
of software should occur in the organization at a
level above the project, so that all projects can
benefit from a common investment. A commonly
cited example is the provision of software pro-
cesses and tooling by the organization.
Software project management can be regarded
as a specialization of “project management”—
often regarded as a distinct discipline. The Proj-
ect Management Institute’s Guide to the Project
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK ®
Guide) is often regarded as the authoritative
source for this knowledge. From time to time,
IEEE adopts the most recent version of the
PMBOK ® Guide as an IEEE standard.


IEEE Std. 1490-2011 Guide—Adoption of the Proj-
ect Management Institute (PMI®) Standard, A
Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowl-
edge (PMBOK® Guide)—Fourth Edition


The PMBOK® Guide identifies that subset of
the project management body of knowledge gen-
erally recognized as good practice. “Generally
recognized” means the knowledge and practices
described are applicable to most projects most of


the time and there is consensus about their value and
usefulness. “Good practice” means there is general
agreement that the application of these skills, tools,
and techniques can enhance the chances of success
over a wide range of projects. Good practice does
not mean the knowledge described should always
be applied uniformly to all projects; the organiza-
tion and/or project management team is respon-
sible for determining what is appropriate for any
given project. The _PMBOK® Guide_ also provides
and promotes a common vocabulary within the
project management profession for discussing,
writing, and applying project management con-
cepts. Such a standard vocabulary is an essential
element of a professional discipline. The Project
Management Institute (PMI) views this standard
as a foundational project management reference
for its professional development programs and
certifications.

The 2008 revisions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207
and 15288 provide project management pro-
cesses for software and systems and relate them
to organization-level processes as well as tech-
nical processes. The jointly developed 16326
standard, replacing two older standards, expands
those provisions with guidance for application.

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326:2009 Systems and Soft-
ware Engineering—Life Cycle Processes—Project
Management**

ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326:2009 provides normative
content specifications for project management
plans covering software projects and software-
intensive system projects. It also provides detailed
discussion and advice on applying a set of proj-
ect processes that are common to both the soft-
ware and system life cycle as covered by ISO/IEC
12207:2008 (IEEE Std. 12207-2008) and ISO/IEC
15288:2008 (IEEE Std. 15288-2008), respectively.
The discussion and advice are intended to aid in
the preparation of the normative content of project
management plans. ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326:2009
is the result of the harmonization of ISO/IEC TR
16326:1999 and IEEE Std. 1058-1998.


Particularly in high-technology applications
and high-consequence projects, the management
of risk is an important aspect of the overall proj-
ect management responsibilities. This standard
deals with that subject.


IEEE Std. 16085-2006 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC 16085:2006)
Standard for Systems and Software Engineering—
Software Life Cycle Processes—Risk Management


ISO/IEC 16085:2006 defines a process for the
management of risk in the life cycle. It can be
added to the existing set of system and software
life cycle processes defined by ISO/IEC 15288 and
ISO/IEC 12207, or it can be used independently.
ISO/IEC 16085:2006 can be applied equally to
systems and software.
The purpose of risk management is to iden-
tify potential managerial and technical problems
before they occur so that actions can be taken that
reduce or eliminate the probability and/or impact
of these problems should they occur. It is a criti-
cal tool for continuously determining the feasi-
bility of project plans, for improving the search
for and identification of potential problems that
can affect life cycle activities and the quality and
performance of products, and for improving the
active management of projects.


The analysis of risk and risk mitigation depends
crucially upon measurement. This international
standard provides an elaboration of the measure-
ment process from ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2008
and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2008.


IEEE Std. 15939-2008 Standard Adoption of ISO/
IEC 15939:2007 Systems and Software Engineer-
ing—Measurement Process


ISO/IEC 15939 defines a measurement process
applicable to system and software engineer-
ing and management disciplines. The process is
described through a model that defines the activi-
ties of the measurement process that are required
to adequately specify what measurement infor-
mation is required, how the measures and analy-
sis results are to be applied, and how to determine



Appendix B B-11

if the analysis results are valid. The measurement
process is flexible, tailorable, and adaptable to the
needs of different users.
ISO/IEC 15939:2007 identifies a process that
supports defining a suitable set of measures that
address specific information needs. It identifies the
activities and tasks that are necessary to success-
fully identify, define, select, apply, and improve
measurement within an overall project or organi-
zational measurement structure. It also provides
definitions for measurement terms commonly used
within the system and software industries.

Software projects often require the develop-
ment of user documentation. Management of the
project, therefore, includes management of the
documentation effort.

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 26511:2012 Systems and Software
Engineering—Requirements for Managers of User
Documentation**

ISO/IEC/IEEE 26511:2012 specifies procedures
for managing user documentation throughout the
software life cycle. It applies to people or orga-
nizations producing suites of documentation, to
those undertaking a single documentation project,
and to documentation produced internally, as well
as to documentation contracted to outside service
organizations. It provides an overview of the soft-
ware documentation and information management
processes, and also presents aspects of portfolio
planning and content management that user docu-
mentation managers apply. It covers management
activities in starting a project, including setting
up procedures and specifications, establishing
infrastructure, and building a team. It includes
examples of roles needed on a user documentation
team. It addresses measurements and estimates
needed for management control, and the use of
supporting processes such as change management,
schedule and cost control, resource management,
and quality management and process improve-
ment. It includes requirements for key documents
produced for user documentation management,
including documentation plans and documentation
management plans. ISO/IEC/IEEE 26511:2012 is
independent of the software tools that may be used


to produce or manage documentation, and applies
to both printed documentation and onscreen docu-
mentation. Much of its guidance is applicable to
user documentation for systems including hard-
ware as well as software.


Sometimes software or system components are
acquired rather than developed.


IEEE Std. 1062-1998 Recommended Practice for
Software Acquisition


A set of useful quality practices that can be
selected and applied during one or more steps in
a software acquisition process is described. This
recommended practice can be applied to software
that runs on any computer system regardless of
the size, complexity, or criticality of the software,
but is more suited for use on modified-off-the-
shelf software and fully developed software.


Sometimes user documentation is acquired
regardless of whether the software it describes
was acquired. The following standard deals with
that subject.


ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011 Systems and Software
Engineering—Requirements for Acquirers and Sup-
pliers of User Documentation


ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011 was developed to
assist users of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2008 or ISO/
IEC/IEEE 12207:2008 to acquire or supply soft-
ware user documentation as part of the software
life cycle processes. It defines the documentation
process from the acquirer’s standpoint and the
supplier’s standpoint. ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011
covers the requirements for information items used
in the acquisition of user documentation products:
the acquisition plan, document specification, state-
ment of work, request for proposals, and proposal.
It provides an overview of the software user docu-
mentation and information management processes
which may require acquisition and supply of soft-
ware user documentation products and services.
It addresses the preparation of requirements for


software user documentation. These requirements
are central to the user documentation specification
and statement of work. It includes requirements
for primary document outputs of the acquisition
and supply process: the request for proposal and
the proposal for user documentation products and
services. It also discusses the use of a documen-
tation management plan and a document plan as
they arise in the acquisition and supply processes.
ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011 is independent of the
software tools that may be used to produce docu-
mentation and applies to both printed documen-
tation and onscreen documentation. Much of its
guidance is applicable to user documentation for
systems including hardware as well as software.

The next two standards are mentioned here
because they supply information used in manage-
ment decision-making.

**IEEE Std. 1028-2008 Standard for Software Reviews
and Audits**
See Software Quality KA

**IEEE Std. 1061-1998 Standard for Software Quality
Metrics Methodology**
See Software Quality KA

The next standard is mentioned because it
includes the manager’s role in developing user
documentation in an agile project.

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 26515:2012 Systems and Software
Engineering—Developing User Documentation in an
Agile Environment**
See Software Engineering Models and
Methods KA

##### SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROCESS

Software and systems engineering processes
are central to the standardization of those two
disciplines—not just because many are inter-
ested in process improvement, but also because
processes are effective for the description of


improved practices. For example, one might pro-
pose an improved practice for software require-
ments analysis. A naïve treatment might relate
the description to an early stage of the life cycle
model. A superior approach is to describe the
practice in the context of a process that can be
applied at any stage of the life cycle. The require-
ments analysis process, for example, is neces-
sary for the development stage, for maintenance,
and often for retirement, so an improved practice
described in terms of the requirements analysis
process can be applied to any of those stages.
The two key standards are ISO/IEC/IEEE
12207, Software Life Cycle Processes , and ISO/
IEC/IEEE 15288, System Life Cycle Processes.
The two standards have distinct histories, but
they were both revised in 2008 to align their pro-
cesses, permitting their interoperable use across a
wide spectrum of projects ranging from a stand-
alone software component to a system with neg-
ligible software content. Both are being revised
again with the intent of containing an identical
list of processes, but with provisions specialized
for the respective disciplines.


IEEE Std. 12207-2008 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC 12207:2008)
Standard for Systems and Software Engineering—
Software Life Cycle Processes


ISO/IEC 12207:2008 establishes a common
framework for software life cycle processes, with
well-defined terminology that can be referenced
by the software industry.
ISO/IEC 12207:2008 applies to the acquisi-
tion of systems and software products and ser-
vices and to the supply, development, operation,
maintenance, and disposal of software products
and the software portion of a system, whether
performed internally or externally to an organiza-
tion. Those aspects of system definition needed
to provide the context for software products and
services are included.
ISO/IEC 12207:2008 also provides a process
that can be employed for defining, controlling,
and improving software life cycle processes.
The processes, activities and tasks of ISO/IEC
12207:2008—either alone or in conjunction with
ISO/IEC 15288—may also be applied during the
acquisition of a system that contains software.



Appendix B B-13

**IEEE Std. 15288-2008 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC 15288:2008)
Standard for Systems and Software Engineering—
System Life Cycle Processes**

ISO/IEC 15288:2008 establishes a common
framework for describing the life cycle of sys-
tems created by humans. It defines a set of
processes and associated terminology. These
processes can be applied at any level in the
hierarchy of a system’s structure. Selected sets
of these processes can be applied throughout
the life cycle for managing and performing the
stages of a system’s life cycle. This is accom-
plished through the involvement of all interested
parties, with the ultimate goal of achieving cus-
tomer satisfaction.
ISO/IEC 15288:2008 also provides processes
that support the definition, control, and improve-
ment of the life cycle processes used within an
organization or a project. Organizations and
projects can use these life cycle processes when
acquiring and supplying systems.
ISO/IEC 15288:2008 concerns those systems
that are man-made and may be configured with
one or more of the following: hardware, software,
data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for pro-
viding service to users), procedures (e.g., opera-
tor instructions), facilities, materials, and natu-
rally occurring entities. When a system element is
software, the software life cycle processes docu-
mented in ISO/IEC 12207:2008 may be used to
implement that system element.
ISO/IEC 15288:2008 and ISO/IEC 12207:2008
are harmonized for concurrent use on a single
project or in a single organization.

Those two standards specify that processes
may produce items of information but do not pre-
scribe their content or format. The next standard
provides help with that.

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2011 Systems and Software
Engineering—Content of Life-Cycle Information
Products (Documentation)**

ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2011 provides require-
ments for identifying and planning the specific


information items (information products, docu-
mentation) to be developed and revised during
systems and software life cycles and service
management processes. It specifies the purpose
and content of all identified systems and software
data records and life cycle information items, as
well as records and information items for infor-
mation technology service management. The
information item contents are defined according
to generic document types (description, plan, pol-
icy, procedure, report, request, and specification)
and the specific purpose of the document. For
simplicity of reference, each information item
is described as if it were published as a separate
document. However, information items may be
unpublished but available in a repository for ref-
erence, divided into separate documents or vol-
umes, or combined with other information items
into one document. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2011
is based on the life cycle processes specified in
ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std. 12207 - 2008)
and ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std. 15288-
2008), and the service management processes
specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2005 and ISO/IEC
20000-2:2005.


The next two guides provide supplementary
information helpful in applying 12207 and 15288.


IEEE Std. 24748.2-2012 Guide—Adoption of ISO/
IEC TR 24748-2:2011 Systems and Software Engi-
neering—Life Cycle Management—Part 2: Guide to
the Application of ISO/IEC 15288 (System Life Cycle
Processes)


ISO/IEC TR 24748-2 is a guide for the applica-
tion of ISO/IEC 15288:2008. It addresses sys-
tem, life cycle, process, organizational, project,
and adaptation concepts, principally through
reference to ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 and ISO/IEC
15288:2008. It then gives guidance on applying
ISO/IEC 15288:2008 from the aspects of strat-
egy, planning, application in organizations, and
application on projects.


IEEE Std. 24748.3-2012 Guide—Adoption of
ISO/IEC TR 24748-3:2011 Systems and Software


**Engineering—Life Cycle Management—Part 3:
Guide to the Application of ISO/IEC 12207 (Soft-
ware Life Cycle Processes)**

ISO/IEC TR 24748-3 is a guide for the applica-
tion of ISO/IEC 12207:2008. It addresses sys-
tem, life cycle, process, organizational, project,
and adaptation concepts, principally through
reference to ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 and ISO/IEC
12207:2008. It gives guidance on applying ISO/
IEC 12207:2008 from the aspects of strategy,
planning, application in organizations, and appli-
cation on projects.

The 12207 and 15288 standards provide pro-
cesses covering the life cycle, but they do not pro-
vide a standard life cycle model (waterfall, incre-
mental delivery, prototype-driven, etc). Selecting
an appropriate life cycle model for a project is a
major concern of ISO/IEC 24748-1.

**IEEE Std. 24748.1-2011 Guide—Adoption of ISO/
IEC TR 24748-1:2010 Systems and Software Engi-
neering—Life Cycle Management—Part 1: Guide
for Life Cycle Management**

ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 provides information on
life cycle concepts and descriptions of the pur-
poses and outcomes of representative life cycle
stages. It also illustrates the use of a life cycle
model for systems in the context of ISO/IEC
15288 and provides a corresponding illustration
of the use of a life cycle model for software in the
context of ISO/IEC 12207. ISO/IEC TR 24748-1
additionally provides detailed discussion and
advice on adapting a life cycle model for use in a
specific project and organizational environment.
It further provides guidance on life cycle model
use by domains, disciplines and specialties. ISO/
IEC TR 24748-1 gives a detailed comparison
between prior and current versions of ISO/IEC
12207 and ISO/IEC 15288 as well as advice on
transitioning from prior to current versions and
on using their application guides. The discus-
sion and advice are intended to provide a refer-
ence model for life cycle models, facilitate use of
the updated ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207,
and provide a framework for the development of


updated application guides for those International
Standards. ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 is a result of the
alignment stage of the harmonization of ISO/IEC
12207 and ISO/IEC 15288.


The next standard extends the provisions of
ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 to deal with systematic
software reuse.


IEEE Std. 1517-2010 Standard for Information
Technology—System and Software Life Cycle Pro-
cesses—Reuse Processes


A common framework for extending the system
and software life cycle processes of IEEE Std.
12207:2008 to include the systematic practice
of reuse is provided. The processes, activities,
and tasks to be applied during each life cycle
process to enable a system and/or product to be
constructed from reusable assets are specified.
The processes, activities, and tasks to enable
the identification, construction, maintenance,
and management of assets supplied are also
specified.


IEEE Std. 1220 has been widely applied as a
systems engineering process and was adopted by
ISO/IEC with the number 26702. Unfortunately,
the standard is not completely compatible with
ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and is being revised to
solve that problem. The result will be published
as ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-4.


IEEE Std. 1220-2005 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC 26702:2007)
Standard for Application and Management of the
Systems Engineering Process


ISO/IEC 26702 defines the interdisciplinary tasks
which are required throughout a system’s life
cycle to transform customer needs, requirements,
and constraints into a system solution. In addi-
tion, it specifies the requirements for the systems
engineering process and its application through-
out the product life cycle. ISO/IEC 26702:2007
focuses on engineering activities necessary to
guide product development, while ensuring



Appendix B B-15

that the product is properly designed to make it
affordable to produce, own, operate, maintain,
and eventually dispose of without undue risk to
health or the environment.

Since SC 7 and IEEE have written so many
process standards, one may not be surprised to
learn that their model for process description is
recorded in a Technical Report.

**IEEE Std. 24774-2012 Guide—Adoption of ISO/IEC
TR 24474:2010 Systems and Software Engineer-
ing—Life Cycle Management—Guidelines for Pro-
cess Description**

An increasing number of international, national,
and industry standards describe process mod-
els. These models are developed for a range of
purposes including process implementation and
assessment. The terms and descriptions used in
such models vary in format, content, and level
of prescription. ISO/IEC TR 24774:2010 pres-
ents guidelines for the elements used most fre-
quently in describing a process: the title, pur-
pose, outcomes, activities, task, and information
item. Whilst the primary purpose of ISO/IEC TR
24774:2010 is to encourage consistency in stan-
dard process reference models, the guidelines it
provides can be applied to any process model
developed for any purpose.

A very small entity (VSE) is an enterprise, an
organization, a department, or a project having
up to 25 people. The ISO/IEC 29110 series “pro-
files” large standards, such as ISO/IEC 12207 for
software and ISO/IEC 15288 for systems, into
smaller ones for VSEs. ISO 29110 is applicable to
VSEs that do not develop critical systems or criti-
cal software. Profiles provide a roadmap allowing
a start-up to grow a step at a time using the ISO
29110 management and engineering guides.
ISO/IEC 29110 set of standards and technical
reports are targeted by audience such as VSEs,
customers, or auditors. ISO/IEC 29110 is not
intended to preclude the use of different life
cycles approaches such as waterfall, iterative,
incremental, evolutionary, or agile.


A VSE could obtain an ISO/IEC 29110 Certi-
fication. The set of technical reports is available
at no cost on the ISO website. Many ISO 29110
documents are available in English, Spanish, Por-
tuguese, Japanese, and French.


ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-2:2011 Software Engineer-
ing—Lifecycle Profiles for Very Small Entities
(VSEs)—Part 5-1-2: Management and Engineering
Guide: Generic Profile Group: Basic Profile


ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-2:2011 is applicable to
very small entities (VSEs). A VSE is defined as
an enterprise, organization, department, or proj-
ect having up to 25 people. A set of standards and
guides has been developed according to a set of
VSEs’ characteristics and needs. The guides are
based on subsets of appropriate standards ele-
ments, referred to as VSE profiles. The purpose
of a VSE profile is to define a subset of ISO/IEC
international standards relevant to the VSEs’
context.
ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-2:2011 provides the
management and engineering guide to the basic
VSE profile applicable to VSEs that do not
develop critical software. The generic profile
group does not imply any specific application
domain.


The next standard may be viewed as an alterna-
tive to 12207 for individual projects. The 1074
standard explains how to define processes for
use on a given project. The 12207 and 15288
standards, however, focus on defining processes
for organizational adoption and repeated use on
many projects. The current 1074 is the update of
a standard that was a predecessor of 12207.


IEEE Std. 1074-2006 Standard for Developing a
Software Project Life Cycle Process


This standard provides a process for creating a
software project life cycle process (SPLCP). It is
primarily directed at the process architect for a
given software project.


All of the standards described so far in this sec-
tion provide a basis for _defining_ processes. Some
users are interested in _assessing_ and improving
their processes after implementation. The 15504
series provides for process assessment; it is cur-
rently being revised and renumbered 330xx.

**ISO/IEC 15504 [ten parts] Information Technol-
ogy—Process Assessment**

ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 defines the requirements
for performing process assessment as a basis
for use in process improvement and capability
determination.
Process assessment is based on a two-dimen-
sional model containing a process dimension and
a capability dimension. The process dimension is
provided by an external process reference model
(such as 12207 or 15288), which defines a set of
processes characterized by statements of process
purpose and process outcomes. The capability
dimension consists of a measurement framework
comprising six process capability levels and their
associated process attributes.
The assessment output consists of a set of pro-
cess attribute ratings for each process assessed,
termed the process profile, and may also include
the capability level achieved by that process.
ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 identifies the measure-
ment framework for process capability and the
requirements for

- performing an assessment;
- process reference models;
- process assessment models;
- verifying conformity of process assessment.

The requirements for process assessment
defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 form a struc-
ture that

- facilitates self-assessment;
- provides a basis for use in process improve-
    ment and capability determination;
- takes into account the context in which the
    assessed process is implemented;
- produces a process rating;
- addresses the ability of the process to achieve
    its purpose;
       - is applicable across all application domains
          and sizes of organization; and
       - may provide an objective benchmark
          between organizations.


The minimum set of requirements defined in
ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 ensures that assessment
results are objective, impartial, consistent, repeat-
able, and representative of the assessed processes.
Results of conformant process assessments may
be compared when the scopes of the assessments
are considered to be similar; for guidance on this
matter, refer to ISO/IEC 15504-4.


Several other standards are mentioned here
because they are written as elaborations of the
processes of 12207 or 15288. They are allocated
to other KAs because each one deals with topics
described in those other KAs.

Some users desire process standards usable
for IT operations or IT service management.
The ISO/IEC 20000 series describe IT service
management. The processes are less rigorously
defined than those of the aforementioned engi-
neering standards, but may be preferable for situ-
ations where the risks of failure involve money
or customer satisfaction rather than public health,
safety, and welfare. The ISO/IEC 20000 series
now extend to many parts. The foundation of
the series, ISO/IEC 20000-1, is briefly described
below.

**ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 Information Technology—
Service Management—Part 1: Service Management
System Requirements**

ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 is a service management
system (SMS) standard. It specifies requirements
for the service provider to plan, establish, imple-
ment, operate, monitor, review, maintain, and
improve an SMS. The requirements include the
design, transition, delivery and improvement of
services to fulfill agreed service requirements.

IEEE has adopted the first two parts of the ISO/
IEC 20000 series.

**SOFTWARE ENGINEERING MODELS
AND METHODS**

Some approaches to software engineering use
methods that cut across large parts of the life
cycle, rather than focusing on specific processes.
“Chief Programmer” was one traditional exam-
ple. “Agile development” (actually an example
of traditional incremental delivery) is a current


example. Neither S2ESC nor SC 7 has a standard
for agile development, but there is a standard
for developing user documentation in an agile
project.


ISO/IEC/IEEE 26515:2012 Systems and Software
Engineering—Developing User Documentation in an
Agile Environment


ISO/IEC/IEEE 26515:2012 specifies the way in
which user documentation can be developed in
agile development projects. It is intended for use
in all organizations that are using agile develop-
ment or are considering implementing their proj-
ects using these techniques. It applies to people
or organizations producing suites of documen-
tation, to those undertaking a single documen-
tation project, and to documentation produced
internally, as well as to documentation contracted
to outside service organizations. ISO/IEC/IEEE
26515:2012 addresses the relationship between
the user documentation process and the life cycle
documentation process in agile development. It
describes how the information developer or proj-
ect manager may plan and manage the user docu-
mentation development in an agile environment.
It is intended neither to encourage nor to discour-
age the use of any particular agile development
tools or methods.


Many methodologies are based on semiformal
descriptions of the software to be constructed.
These range from simple descriptive notations
to models that can be manipulated and tested
and, in some cases, can generate code. Two rela-
tively old techniques start the list; the first has
been widely applied for modeling processes and
workflows.


IEEE Std. 1320.1-1998 Standard for Functional Mod-
eling Language—Syntax and Semantics for IDEF0


IDEF0 function modeling is designed to repre-
sent the decisions, actions, and activities of an
existing or prospective organization or system.
IDEF0 graphics and accompanying texts are pre-
sented in an organized and systematic way to gain


understanding, support analysis, provide logic for
potential changes, specify requirements, and sup-
port system-level design and integration activi-
ties. IDEF0 may be used to model a wide variety
of systems, composed of people, machines, mate-
rials, computers, and information of all varieties,
and structured by the relationships among them,
both automated and nonautomated. For new sys-
tems, IDEF0 may be used first to define require-
ments and to specify the functions to be carried
out by the future system. As the basis of this
architecture, IDEF0 may then be used to design
an implementation that meets these requirements
and performs these functions. For existing sys-
tems, IDEF0 can be used to analyze the functions
that the system performs and to record the means
by which these are done.

**IEEE Std. 1320.2-1998 Standard for Conceptual
Modeling Language—Syntax and Semantics for
IDEF1X97 (IDEFobject)**

IDEF1X 97 consists of two conceptual modeling
languages. The key-style language supports data/
information modeling and is downward compat-
ible with the US government’s 1993 standard,
FIPS PUB 184. The identity-style language is
based on the object model with declarative rules
and constraints. IDEF1X 97 identity style includes
constructs for the distinct but related components
of object abstraction: interface, requests, and
realization; utilizes graphics to state the interface;
and defines a declarative, directly executable rule
and constraint language for requests and realiza-
tions. IDEF1X 97 conceptual modeling supports
implementation by relational databases, extended
relational databases, object databases, and object
programming languages. IDEF1X 97 is formally
defined in terms of first order logic. A procedure
is given whereby any valid IDEF1X 97 model
can be transformed into an equivalent theory in
first order logic. That procedure is then applied to
a metamodel of IDEF1X 97 to define the valid set
of IDEF1X 97 models.

In recent years, the UML notation has become
popular for modeling software-intensive systems.


The next two standards provide two versions of
the UML language.


ISO/IEC 19501:2005 Information Technology—
Open Distributed Processing—Unified Modeling
Language (UML) Version 1.4.2


ISO/IEC 19501 describes the Unified Model-
ing Language (UML), a graphical language for
visualizing, specifying, constructing, and docu-
menting the artifacts of a software-intensive sys-
tem. The UML offers a standard way to write a
system’s blueprints, including conceptual things
such as business processes and system functions
as well as concrete things such as programming
language statements, database schemas, and reus-
able software components.


ISO/IEC 19505:2012 [two parts] Information Tech-
nology—Object Management Group Unified Model-
ing Language (OMG UML)


ISO/IEC 19505 defines the Unified Modeling
Language (UML), revision 2. The objective of
UML is to provide system architects, software
engineers, and software developers with tools for
analysis, design, and implementation of software-
based systems as well as for modeling business
and similar processes.


Two more standards build on the base of UML
to provide additional modeling capabilities:


ISO/IEC 19506:2012 Information Technology—
Object Management Group Architecture-Driven
Modernization (ADM)—Knowledge Discovery
Meta-Model (KDM)


ISO/IEC 19506:2012 defines a metamodel for rep-
resenting existing software assets, their associa-
tions, and operational environments, referred to as
the knowledge discovery metamodel (KDM). This
is the first in the series of specifications related to
software assurance (SwA) and architecture-driven
modernization (ADM) activities. KDM facilitates



Appendix B B-19

projects that involve existing software systems
by insuring interoperability and exchange of data
between tools provided by different vendors.

**ISO/IEC 19507:2012 Information Technology—
Object Management Group Object Constraint Lan-
guage (OCL)**

ISO/IEC 19507:2012 defines the Object Con-
straint Language (OCL), version 2.3.1. OCL ver-
sion 2.3.1 is the version of OCL that is aligned
with UML 2.3 and MOF 2.0.

Some organizations invest in software engi-
neering environments (SEE) to assist in the
construction of software. An SEE, per se, is not
a replacement for sound processes. However, a
suitable SEE must support the processes that
have been chosen by the organization.

**ISO/IEC 15940:2006 Information Technology—
Software Engineering Environment Services**

ISO/IEC 15940:2006 defines software engineering
environment (SEE) services conceptually in a refer-
ence model that can be adapted to any SEEs to auto-
mate one or more software engineering activities.
It describes services that support the process defini-
tions as in ISO/IEC 12207 so that the set of SEE
services is compatible with ISO/IEC 12207. ISO/
IEC 15940:2006 can be used either as a general ref-
erence or to define an automated software process.

The selection of tooling for a software engineering
environment is itself a difficult task. Two standards
provide some assistance. ISO/IEC 14102:2008
defines both a set of processes and a structured set of
computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tool
characteristics for use in the technical evaluation
and the ultimate selection of a CASE tool.

**IEEE Std. 14102-2010 Standard Adoption of ISO/
IEC 14102:2008 Information Technology—Guide-
line for the Evaluation and Selection of CASE Tools**


Within systems and software engineering, com-
puter-aided software engineering (CASE) tools
represent a major part of the supporting tech-
nologies used to develop and maintain informa-
tion technology systems. Their selection must be
carried out with careful consideration of both the
technical and management requirements.
ISO/IEC 14102:2008 defines both a set of pro-
cesses and a structured set of CASE tool char-
acteristics for use in the technical evaluation and
the ultimate selection of a CASE tool. It follows
the software product evaluation model defined in
ISO/IEC 14598-5:1998.
ISO/IEC 14102:2008 adopts the general model
of software product quality characteristics and
subcharacteristics defined in ISO/IEC 9126-
1:2001 and extends these when the software
product is a CASE tool; it provides product char-
acteristics unique to CASE tools.


The next document provides guidance on how
to adopt CASE tools, once selected.


IEEE Std. 14471-2010 Guide—Adoption of ISO/IEC
TR 14471:2007 Information Technology—Software
Engineering—Guidelines for the Adoption of CASE
Tools


The purpose of ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 is to
provide a recommended practice for CASE adop-
tion. It provides guidance in establishing pro-
cesses and activities that are to be applied for
the successful adoption of CASE technology.
The use of ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 will help
to maximize the return and minimize the risk of
investing in CASE technology. However, ISO/
IEC TR 14471:2007 does not establish compli-
ance criteria.
It is best used in conjunction with ISO/IEC
14102 for CASE tool evaluation and selection. It
neither dictates nor advocates particular develop-
ment standards, software processes, design meth-
ods, methodologies, techniques, programming
languages, or life cycle paradigms.


Within a software engineering environment, it
is important for the various tools to interoperate.
The following standards provide a scheme for
interconnection.

**IEEE Std. 1175.1-2002 Guide for CASE Tool Inter-
connections—Classification and Description**

**IEEE Std. 1175.2-2006 Recommended Practice for
CASE Tool Interconnection—Characterization of
Interconnections**

**IEEE Std. 1175.3-2004 Standard for CASE Tool
Interconnections—Reference Model for Specifying
Software Behavior**

**IEEE Std. 1175.4-2008 Standard for CASE Tool
Interconnections—Reference Model for Specifying
System Behavior**

The purpose of this family of standards is to spec-
ify a common set of modeling concepts based
on those found in commercial CASE tools for
describing the operational behavior of a software
system. These standards establish a uniform,
integrated model of software concepts related to
software functionality. They also provide a tex-
tual syntax for expressing the common properties
(attributes and relationships) of those concepts as
they have been used to model software behavior.

##### SOFTWARE QUALITY

One viewpoint of software quality starts with
ISO 9001, _Quality Management Requirements_ ,
dealing with quality policy throughout an orga-
nization. The terminology of that standard may
be unfamiliar to software professionals, and
quality management auditors may be unfamiliar
with software jargon. The following standard
describes the relationship between ISO 9001 and
ISO/IEC 12207. Unfortunately, the current ver-
sion refers to obsolete editions of both; a replace-
ment is in progress:

**IEEE Std. 90003-2008 Guide—Adoption of ISO/
IEC 90003:2004 Software Engineering—Guidelines**


for the Application of ISO 9001:2000 to Computer
Software


ISO/IEC 90003 provides guidance for organiza-
tions in the application of ISO 9001:2000 to the
acquisition, supply, development, operation, and
maintenance of computer software and related
support services. ISO/IEC 90003:2004 does not
add to or otherwise change the requirements of
ISO 9001:2000.
The guidelines provided in ISO/IEC
90003:2004 are not intended to be used as assess-
ment criteria in quality management system
registration/certification.
The application of ISO/IEC 90003:2004 is
appropriate to software that is

- part of a commercial contract with another
    organization,
- a product available for a market sector,
- used to support the processes of an
    organization,
- embedded in a hardware product, or
- related to software services.


Some organizations may be involved in all
the above activities; others may specialize in
one area. Whatever the situation, the organiza-
tion’s quality management system should cover
all aspects (software related and nonsoftware
related) of the business.
ISO/IEC 90003:2004 identifies the issues
which should be addressed and is independent
of the technology, life cycle models, develop-
ment processes, sequence of activities, and
organizational structure used by an organiza-
tion. Additional guidance and frequent ref-
erences to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 software
engineering standards are provided to assist in
the application of ISO 9001:2000: in particu-
lar, ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC TR 9126, ISO/
IEC 14598, ISO/IEC 15939, and ISO/IEC TR
15504.


The ISO 9001 approach posits an organiza-
tion-level quality management process paired
with project-level quality assurance planning
to achieve the organizational goals. IEEE 730
describes project-level quality planning. It is



Appendix B B-21

currently aligned with an obsolete edition of
12207, but a revision is being prepared.

**IEEE Std. 730-2002 Standard for Software Quality
Assurance Plans**

The standard specifies the format and content of
software quality assurance plans.

Another viewpoint of software quality begins
with enumerating the desired characteristics of a
software product and selecting measures or other
evaluations to determine if the desired level of
characteristics has been achieved. The so-called
SQuaRE (software product quality requirements
and evaluation) series of SC 7 standards covers
this approach in great detail.

**ISO/IEC 25000 through 25099 Software Engineer-
ing—Software Product Quality Requirements and
Evaluation (SQuaRE)**

A few of the SQuaRE standards are selected
below for particular attention. The first is the
overall guide to the series.

**ISO/IEC 25000:2005 Software Engineering—Soft-
ware Product Quality Requirements and Evaluation
(SQuaRE)—Guide to SQuaRE**

ISO/IEC 25000:2005 provides guidance for the
use of the new series of international standards
named Software product Quality Requirements
and Evaluation (SQuaRE). The purpose of this
guide is to provide a general overview of SQuaRE
contents, common reference models, and defini-
tions, as well as the relationship among the docu-
ments, allowing users of this guide a good under-
standing of those international standards. This
document contains an explanation of the transi-
tion process between the old ISO/IEC 9126 and
the 14598 series and SQuaRE, and also presents
information on how to use the ISO/IEC 9126 and
14598 series in their previous form.


SQuaRE provides

- terms and definitions,
- reference models,
- guides
- standards for requirements specification,
    planning and management, measurement,
    and evaluation purposes.


The next SQuaRE standard provides a taxon-
omy of software quality characteristics that may
be useful in selecting characteristics relevant to a
specific project:


ISO/IEC 25010:2011 Systems and Software Engi-
neering—Systems and Software Quality Require-
ments and Evaluation (SQuaRE)—System and Soft-
ware Quality Models


ISO/IEC 25010:2011 defines the following:

1. A quality in-use model composed of five
    characteristics (some of which are further
    subdivided into subcharacteristics) that
    relate to the outcome of interaction when a
    product is used in a particular context of use.
    This system model is applicable to the com-
    plete human-computer system, including
    both computer systems in use and software
    products in use.
2. A product quality model composed of eight
    characteristics (which are further subdivided
    into subcharacteristics) that relate to static
    properties of software and dynamic proper-
    ties of the computer system. The model is
    applicable to both computer systems and
    software products.


The characteristics defined by both models
are relevant to all software products and com-
puter systems. The characteristics and subchar-
acteristics provide consistent terminology for
specifying, measuring, and evaluating system
and software product quality. They also provide
a set of quality characteristics against which
stated quality requirements can be compared for
completeness.


Although the scope of the product quality
model is intended to be software and computer
systems, many of the characteristics are also rel-
evant to wider systems and services.
ISO/IEC 25012 contains a model for data qual-
ity that is complementary to this model.
The scope of the models excludes purely func-
tional properties, but it does include functional
suitability.
The scope of application of the quality models
includes supporting specification and evaluation
of software and software-intensive computer sys-
tems from different perspectives by those who are
associated with their acquisition, requirements,
development, use, evaluation, support, mainte-
nance, quality assurance and control, and audit.
The models can, for example, be used by devel-
opers, acquirers, quality assurance and control
staff, and independent evaluators, particularly
those responsible for specifying and evaluating
software product quality. Activities during prod-
uct development that can benefit from the use of
the quality models include

- identifying software and system requirements;
- validating the comprehensiveness of a
    requirements definition;
- identifying software and system design
    objectives;
- identifying software and system testing
    objectives;
- identifying quality control criteria as part of
    quality assurance;
- identifying acceptance criteria for a software
    product and/or software-intensive computer
    system;
- establishing measures of quality characteris-
    tics in support of these activities.

Some documents in the SQuaRE series deal spe-
cifically with the characteristic of usability. The
Common Industry Format (CIF) for usability report-
ing began at the US National Institute for Standards
and Technology (NIST) and was moved into ISO/
IEC JTC 1/SC 7 for purposes of standardization.

**ISO/IEC 25060 through 25064 Software Engineer-
ing—Software Product Quality Requirements and**


Evaluation (SQuaRE)—Common Industry Format
(CIF) for Usability


A family of international standards, named the
Common Industry Formats (CIF), documents
the specification and evaluation of the usability
of interactive systems. It provides a general over-
view of the CIF framework and contents, defini-
tions, and the relationship of the framework ele-
ments. The intended users of the framework are
identified, as well as the situations in which the
framework may be applied. The assumptions and
constraints of the framework are also enumerated.
The framework content includes the following:

- consistent terminology and classification of
    specification, evaluation, and reporting;
- a definition of the type and scope of formats
    and the high-level structure to be used for
    documenting required information and the
    results of evaluation.


The CIF family of standards is applicable to
software and hardware products used for pre-
defined tasks. The information items are intended
to be used as part of system-level documentation
resulting from development processes such as
those in ISO 9241-210 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7
process standards.
The CIF family focuses on documenting those
elements needed for design and development of
usable systems, rather than prescribing a specific
process. It is intended to be used in conjunction
with existing international standards, includ-
ing ISO 9241, ISO 20282, ISO/IEC 9126, and
the SQuaRE series (ISO/IEC 25000 to ISO/IEC
25099).
The CIF family of standards does not prescribe
any kind of method, life cycle or process.


Not everyone agrees with the taxonomy of
quality characteristics in ISO/IEC 25010. That
standard has a quality factor called “reliability”
that has subfactors of maturity, availability, fault
tolerance, and recoverability. IEC TC 65, which
has responsibility for standards on “dependabil-
ity,” defines that term as a nonquantitative com-
posite of reliability, maintainability, and mainte-
nance support. Others use the term “reliability”



Appendix B B-23

to denote a measure defined by a mathematical
equation. The disagreement over the use of these
words means that the standards on the subject are
inherently unaligned. A few will be noted below,
but the words like those noted above may mean
different things in different standards.

**IEEE Std. 982.1-2005 Standard for Dictionary of
Measures of the Software Aspects of Dependability**

A standard dictionary of measures of the soft-
ware aspects of dependability for assessing and
predicting the reliability, maintainability, and
availability of any software system; in particular,
it applies to mission critical software systems.

**IEEE Std. 1633-2008 Recommended Practice for
Software Reliability**

The methods for assessing and predicting the reli-
ability of software, based on a life cycle approach
to software reliability engineering, are prescribed in
this recommended practice. It provides information
necessary for the application of software reliability
(SR) measurement to a project, lays a foundation
for building consistent methods, and establishes
the basic principle for collecting the data needed to
assess and predict the reliability of software. The
recommended practice prescribes how any user can
participate in SR assessments and predictions.

IEEE has an overall standard for software
product quality that has a scope similar to the
ISO/IEC 250xx series described previously. Its
terminology differs from the ISO/IEC series, but
it is substantially more compact.

**IEEE Std. 1061-1998 Standard for Software Quality
Metrics Methodology**

A methodology for establishing quality require-
ments and identifying, implementing, analyzing,
and validating the process and product software
quality metrics is defined. The methodology
spans the entire software life cycle.


One approach to achieving software quality is
to perform an extensive program of verification
and validation. IEEE Std. 1012 is probably the
world’s most widely applied standard on this sub-
ject. A revision was recently published.


IEEE Std. 1012-2012 Standard for System and Soft-
ware Verification and Validation


Verification and validation (V&V) processes are
used to determine whether the development prod-
ucts of a given activity conform to the require-
ments of that activity and whether the product
satisfies its intended use and user needs. V&V life
cycle process requirements are specified for differ-
ent integrity levels. The scope of V&V processes
encompasses systems, software, and hardware, and
it includes their interfaces. This standard applies to
systems, software, and hardware being developed,
maintained, or reused [legacy, commercial off-the-
shelf (COTS), nondevelopmental items]. The term
software also includes firmware and microcode,
and each of the terms system, software, and hard-
ware includes documentation. V&V processes
include the analysis, evaluation, review, inspec-
tion, assessment, and testing of products.


There are other standards that support the veri-
fication and validation processes. One describes
techniques for performing reviews and audits
during a software project.


IEEE Std. 1028-2008 Standard for Software Reviews
and Audits


Five types of software reviews and audits,
together with procedures required for the execu-
tion of each type, are defined in this standard.
This standard is concerned only with the reviews
and audits; procedures for determining the neces-
sity of a review or audit are not defined, and the
disposition of the results of the review or audit
is not specified. Types included are management
reviews, technical reviews, inspections, walk-
throughs, and audits.


In many cases, a database of software anoma-
lies is used to support verification and validation
activities. The following standard suggests how
anomalies should be classified.

**IEEE Std. 1044-2009 Standard for Classification for
Software Anomalies**

This standard provides a uniform approach to the
classification of software anomalies, regardless
of when they originate or when they are encoun-
tered within the project, product, or system life
cycle. Classification data can be used for a vari-
ety of purposes, including defect causal analy-
sis, project management, and software process
improvement (e.g., to reduce the likelihood of
defect insertion and/or increase the likelihood of
early defect detection).

In some systems, one particular property of the
software is so important that it requires special
treatment beyond that provided by a conven-
tional verification and validation program. The
emerging term for this sort of treatment is “sys-
tems and software assurance.” Examples include
safety, privacy, high security, and ultrareliability.
The 15026 standard is under development to deal
with such situations. The first part of the four-part
standard provides terminology and concepts used
in the remaining parts. It was first written before
the other parts and is now being revised for com-
plete agreement with the others.

**IEEE Std. 15026.1-2011 Trial-Use Standard Adop-
tion of ISO/IEC TR 15026-1:2010 Systems and Soft-
ware Engineering—Systems and Software Assur-
ance—Part 1: Concepts and Vocabulary**

This trial-use standard adopts ISO/IEC TR 15026-1:2010, which defines terms and
estab- lishes an extensive and organized set of concepts and their
relationships for software and systems assurance, thereby establishing a basis
for shared understanding of the concepts and principles cen- tral to ISO/IEC
15026 across its user communi- ties. It provides information to users of the
sub- sequent parts of ISO/IEC 15026, including the


use of each part and the combined use of multiple
parts. Coverage of assurance for a service being
operated and managed on an ongoing basis is not
covered in ISO/IEC 15026.


The second part of the standard describes the
structure of an “assurance case,” which is intended
as a structured argument that the critical property
has been achieved. It is a generalization of various
domain-specific constructs like “safety cases.”


IEEE Std. 15026.2-2011 Standard Adoption of ISO/
IEC 15026-2:2011 Systems and Software Engineer-
ing—Systems and Software Assurance—Part 2:
Assurance Case


ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 is adopted by this stan-
dard. ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 specifies minimum
requirements for the structure and contents of an
assurance case to improve the consistency and
comparability of assurance cases and to facili-
tate stakeholder communications, engineering
decisions, and other uses of assurance cases. An
assurance case includes a top-level claim for a
property of a system or product (or set of claims),
systematic argumentation regarding this claim,
and the evidence and explicit assumptions that
underlie this argumentation. Arguing through
multiple levels of subordinate claims, this struc-
tured argumentation connects the top-level claim
to the evidence and assumptions. Assurance
cases are generally developed to support claims
in areas such as safety, reliability, maintain-
ability, human factors, operability, and security,
although these assurance cases are often called
by more specific names, e.g., safety case or reli-
ability and maintainability (R&M) case. ISO/IEC
15026-2:2011 does not place requirements on
the quality of the contents of an assurance case
and does not require the use of a particular termi-
nology or graphical representation. Likewise, it
places no requirements on the means of physical
implementation of the data, including no require-
ments for redundancy or colocation.


In many systems, some portions are critical to
achieving the desired property while others are only



Appendix B B-25

incidental. For example, the flight control system of
an airliner is critical to safety, but the microwave
oven is not. Conventionally, the various portions
are assigned “criticality levels” to indicate their sig-
nificance to the overall achievement of the property.
The third part of ISO/IEC 15026 describes how that
is done. This part will be revised for better fit with
the remainder of the 15026 standard.

**ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 Systems and Software Engi-
neering—Systems and Software Assurance—Part 3:
System Integrity Levels**

ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 specifies the concept of
integrity levels with corresponding integrity level
requirements that are required to be met in order
to show the achievement of the integrity level. It
places requirements on and recommends meth-
ods for defining and using integrity levels and
their integrity level requirements, including the
assignment of integrity levels to systems, soft-
ware products, their elements, and relevant exter-
nal dependences.
ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 is applicable to sys-
tems and software and is intended for use by:

- definers of integrity levels such as industry
    and professional organizations, standards
    organizations, and government agencies;
- users of integrity levels such as developers
    and maintainers, suppliers and acquirers,
    users, and assessors of systems or software,
    and for the administrative and technical sup-
    port of systems and/or software products.

One important use of integrity levels is by sup-
pliers and acquirers in agreements; for example,
to aid in assuring safety, economic, or security
characteristics of a delivered system or product.
ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 does not prescribe a
specific set of integrity levels or their integrity
level requirements. In addition, it does not pre-
scribe the way in which integrity level use is inte-
grated with the overall system or software engi-
neering life cycle processes.
ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 can be used alone or
with other parts of ISO/IEC 15026. It can be used
with a variety of technical and specialized risk
analysis and development approaches. ISO/IEC


TR 15026-1 provides additional information and
references to aid users of ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011.
ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 does not require the
use of the assurance cases described by ISO/IEC
15026-2 but describes how integrity levels and
assurance cases can work together, especially in
the definition of specifications for integrity levels
or by using integrity levels within a portion of an
assurance case.


The final part of 15026 provides additional
guidance for executing the life cycle processes of
12207 and 15288 when a system or software is
required to achieve an important property.


ISO/IEC 15026-4:2012 Systems and Software Engi-
neering—Systems and Software Assurance—Part 4:
Assurance in the Life Cycle


This part of ISO/IEC 15026 gives guidance and
recommendations for conducting selected pro-
cesses, activities and tasks for systems and software
products requiring assurance claims for properties
selected for special attention, called critical proper-
ties. This part of ISO/IEC 15026 specifies a prop-
erty-independent list of processes, activities, and
tasks to achieve the claim and show the achieve-
ment of the claim. This part of ISO/IEC 15026
establishes the processes, activities, tasks, guidance,
and recommendations in the context of a defined
life cycle model and set of life cycle processes for
system and/or software life cycle management.


The next standard deals with a property—
safety—that is often identified as critical. It was
originally developed in cooperation with the US
nuclear power industry.


IEEE Std. 1228-1994 Standard for Software Safety
Plans


The minimum acceptable requirements for the
content of a software safety plan are established.
This standard applies to the software safety plan
used for the development, procurement, mainte-
nance, and retirement of safety-critical software.


This standard requires that the plan be prepared
within the context of the system safety pro-
gram. Only the safety aspects of the software are
included. This standard does not contain special
provisions required for software used in distrib-
uted systems or in parallel processors.

Classical treatments suggest that “verification”
deals with static evaluation methods and that
“testing” deals with dynamic evaluation meth-
ods. Recent treatments, including ISO/IEC draft
29119, are blurring this distinction, though, so
testing standards are mentioned here.

##### SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

##### PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE

IEEE is a provider of products related to the cer-
tification of professional practitioners of software
engineering. The first has already been described,
the _Guide to the Software Engineering Body of
Knowledge_. The _SWEBOK Guide_ has been adopted
by ISO/IEC as an outline of the knowledge that pro-
fessional software engineers should have.

**ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005 Software Engineer-
ing—Guide to the Software Engineering Body of**


Knowledge (SWEBOK)
See General


An SC 7 standard provides a framework for
comparisons among certifications of software
engineering professionals. That standard states
that the areas considered in certification must be
mapped to the SWEBOK Guide.


ISO/IEC 24773:2008 Software Engineering—Certi-
fication of Software Engineering Professionals


ISO/IEC 24773:2008 establishes a framework for
comparison of schemes for certifying software
engineering professionals. A certification scheme
is a set of certification requirements for software
engineering professionals. ISO/IEC 24773:2008
specifies the items that a scheme is required to
contain and indicates what should be defined for
each item.
ISO/IEC 24773:2008 will facilitate the porta-
bility of software engineering professional cer-
tifications between different countries or orga-
nizations. At present, different countries and
organizations have adopted different approaches
on the topic, which are implemented by means
of regulations and bylaws. The intention of ISO/
IEC 24773:2008 is to be open to these individ-
ual approaches by providing a framework for
expressing them in a common scheme that can
lead to understanding.


SC 7 is currently drafting a guide that will sup-
plement 24773.

**STAYING CURRENT**

This article was obsolescent the moment it was
drafted. Some readers will need to know how
to get current designations and descriptions of
standards. This section describes some helpful
resources.

**WHERE TO FIND STANDARDS**

The list of standards published for ISO/IEC JTC
1/SC 7 can be found at [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_)
catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.
htm?commid=45086.
Because the URL might change, readers might
have to navigate to the list. Begin at [http://www.iso.org/](http://www.iso.org/)
iso/store.htm, then click on “browse standards
catalogue,” then “browse by TC,” then “JTC 1,”
then “SC 7.”
Finding the current list of standards for S2ESC
is a bit more difficult. Begin at [http://standards.](http://standards.)
ieee.org/. In the search box under “Find Stan-
dards,” type “S2ESC.” This should produce a
list of published standards for which S2ESC is
responsible.
Keep in mind that the searchable databases
are compilations. Like any such database, they
can contain errors that lead to incomplete search
results.

**WHERE TO OBTAIN THE STANDARDS**

Some readers will want to obtain standards
described in this article. The first thing to
know is that some international standards are
available free for individual use. The current
list of ISO/IEC standards available under these
terms is located at [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/](http://standards.iso.org/ittf/)
PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html.
One of the publicly available standards is the
ISO/IEC adoption of the _SWEBOK Guide_ , ISO/
IEC 19759.


The definitions contained in ISO/IEC/IEEE
24765, System and Software Vocabulary , are
freely available at http://www.computer.org/sevocab.
However, the vast majority of standards are not
free. ISO/IEC standards are generally purchased
from the national standards organization of the
country in which one lives. For example, in the
US, international standards can be purchased
from the American National Standards Institute
at http://webstore.ansi.org/. Alternatively, stan-
dards can be purchased directly from ISO/IEC
at http://www.iso.org/iso/store.htm. It should be noted
that each individual nation is free to set its own
prices, so it may be helpful to check both sources.
IEEE standards may be available to you for
free if your employer or library has a subscription
to IEEE Xplore: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/. Some
subscriptions to Xplore provide access only to
the abstracts of standards; the full text may then
be purchased via Xplore. Alternatively, standards
may be purchased via the IEEE standards store at
http://www.techstreet.com/ieeegate.html. It should be
noted that IEEE-SA sometimes bundles standards
into groups available at a substantial discount.
Finally, the reader should note that standards
that IEEE has adopted from ISO/IEC, standards
that ISO/IEC has “fast-tracked” from IEEE, and
standards that were jointly developed or revised
are available from both sources. For all standards
described in this article, the IEEE version and the
ISO/IEC version are substantively identical. The
respective versions may have different front and
back matter but the bodies are identical.


WHERE TO SEE THE SWEBOK GUIDE


The SWEBOK Guide is published under an IEEE
copyright. The current version of the SWEBOK
Guide is available free to the public at http://www.
swebok.org/. The ISO/IEC adoption of the
SWEBOK Guide , ISO/IEC TR 19759, is one of
the freely available standards.

**APPENDIX C**

**CONSOLIDATED REFERENCE LIST**

The Consolidated Reference List identifies all recommended reference materials
(to the level of section number) that accompany the breakdown of topics within
each knowledge area (KA). This Consolidated Reference List is adopted by the
software engineering certification and associated professional development
products offered by the IEEE Computer Society. KA Editors used the ref- erences
allocated to their KA by the Consolidated Reference List as their Recommended
References.  Collectively this Consolidated Reference List is

- Complete: Covering the entire scope of the _SWEBOK Guide_.
- Sufficient: Providing enough information to describe “generally accepted”
knowledge.
- Consistent: Not providing contradictory knowledge nor conflicting practices.
- Credible: Recognized as providing expert treatment.
- Current: Treating the subject in a manner that is commensurate with currently
generally accepted knowledge.
- Succinct: As short as possible (both in num- ber of reference items and in
total page count) without failing other objectives.
